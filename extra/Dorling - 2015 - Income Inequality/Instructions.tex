\section*{The Distribution of Incomes in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom}

The purpose of this project is to explore the distribution of income in the five most populated European countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The data comes from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EUSILC) Microdata. In total, 228,692 households were surveyed: 8058 households in the UK; 13,512 in Germany; 11,360 in France; 19,399 in Italy; and 13,109 in Spain. 

Table~1 gives a detailed breakdown of gross household incomes in euros, by income level strata $0-100$, $100-200$, $...$, $3900000-4000000$, with increments of different euro-sizes. 


\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Create a plot of the distribution that you feel best illustrates the data.

\item 
Create a plot of the income shares for the following quantiles of interest: Top~0.1\%, Top~1\%, Top~10\%, Top~50\%, Bottom~10\%, Bottom~1\%.

\end{enumerate}
