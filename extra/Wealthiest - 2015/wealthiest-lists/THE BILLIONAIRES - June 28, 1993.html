                Gold was the color of the Sultan's silver jubilee, which he celebrated last October. On the 25th anniversary of his accession to the throne, he was driven through the streets in a
                gilded chariot drawn by 40 men. Brunei, which occupies a tiny corner of the island of Borneo, has extensive oil and gas reserves -- which the Sultan controls. How handy to have a
                filling station on the grounds when you have 165 Rolls-Royces.

                42 Bentonville ARKANSAS $23.5 38% of Wal-Mart Stores. It's news when a Walton -- the late Sam Walton's nephew John J. Robson -- loses money shorting Wal-Mart stock. Not something any
                of Sam's four kids would do. Rob, the eldest, serves as Wal-Mart's chairman. When he took a leave of absence from the company in the mid-1980s to train for the Ironman triathlon in
                Hawaii, there were people who mistakenly thought that signaled he didn't have much interest in running the store. Jim is president of Walton Enterprises, the family holding company.
                Even John, who manufactures boats in California, pulled for the family team by going on the Wal-Mart board. Alice, an investment banker, is pushing to develop an airport in
                northwestern Arkansas. Can she count on help from some old pals named Bill and Hillary?

                M&amp;M/Mars, Uncle Ben's Rice, Pedigree pet food, Mars Electronics. Candy wasn't so dandy for the Mars clan this year. The conglomerate launched a low-cal Milky Way II, made with
                polydextrose and a fat called caprenin (mmmmm!), but consumers failed to swallow the idea. There was also the trademark infringement case Mars brought against a Los Angeles lawyer who
                marketed an M&amp;M clone called the Green Ones. Victory was only semisweet: The court ruled that the product could still be sold under a different name -- Greenies.

                4 MINORU MORI, 58 AKIRA MORI, 56 Tokyo JAPAN $13.0 Mori Building Co.; Mori Building Development; real estate. Minoru, CEO of Mori Building, and Akira, CEO of the development company,
                are the richest men in Japan. But the troubled Japanese economy has clipped $1 billion off their net worth. Inheritors of the fortune of their father, Taikichiro, the brothers plan to
                follow his ways. That includes Minoru's dwelling in an apartment -- he told Fortune: ''That way I can understand what tenants really need'' -- and their continuing to develop projects
                in Minato-ku, a central Tokyo ward favored by their dad.

                5 SAMUEL I. NEWHOUSE JR., 65 DONALD NEWHOUSE, 63 and family New York NEW YORK $10.0 100% of Advance Publications. Media siblings Si and Donald Newhouse try to stay out of the news,
                but Si keeps attracting unwanted attention with his slash-and-burn theory of management. Most recently he folded Conde Nast's venerable shelter magazine, HG, after buying its rival
                Architectural Digest. But just when you started wondering whether Si is completely heartless, Self magazine began distributing a new promotional item -- his-and-her leather condom
                cases.

                6 KING FAHD BIN ABDUL-AZIZ AL SAUD, 73 Riyadh SAUDI ARABIA $10.0 Saudi Arabia's oil revenues; real estate. With 40 years of experience in government, the King is a master at ruling by
                compromise rather than confrontation. Every dollar of oil that is pumped out of Saudi Arabia adds to a pool of capital that he can draw on, although he does not do so very often.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                7 JOHN WERNER KLUGE, 78 Charlottesville VIRGINIA $8.8 95% of Metromedia Co.: telecommunications and restaurants; real estate; cash. Kluge recently gave $60 million to Columbia
                University, his alma mater, for minority scholarships. He has not forgotten how hard it was for him to afford tuition when he earned $7 a week working in the school dining hall. His
                fortune is the equivalent of $7 a week, provided one lived 24 million years.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                8 GAD RAUSING, 71 London ENGLAND HANS RAUSING 67 Sussex ENGLAND $8.5 100% of Tetra-Laval, liquid-food packaging and agricultural equipment. The Rausings are Swedes who live in England
                and who have incorporated their company in Switzerland. Confusing, no? Well, the brothers have bigger problems than figuring out their nationality. The throwaway nature of Tetra's
                products is a drawback in the ecologically conscious West. So the company is expanding into Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where environmental rules are easier.
              </p>

                9 QUEEN ELIZABETH II, 67 London ENGLAND $7.8 Agricultural land; premier London real estate; vast stock portfolio; art; jewelry; stamps; porcelain; furniture; racehorses. Although
                she'll take some exemptions -- the Royal Art Collection, the yacht Britannia, Windsor Castle, and Buckingham Palace -- 1993 marks the first time that H.M. will pay taxes, said to
                range between 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) and 2 million pounds. And she thinks last year was the annus horribilis.

                10 TOICHI TAKENAKA, 50 and family Hyogo JAPAN $7.1 77.9% of Takenaka Komuten, construction. This CEO of a 400-year-old construction firm never goes anywhere without a pair of cleats.
                His firm, which made its reputation building Emperor Hirohito's residence in Tokyo, is now building golf courses. When Takenaka isn't busy testing them, he's climbing mountains. He
                has already scaled the Japanese Alps, which run through Nagano; this summer it's the other Alps.

                11 SHEIKH JABER AHMED AL-SABAH, 67 and family KUWAIT $7.0 Vast foreign investments; real estate. Recent times have been rough for this royal. He narrowly escaped assassination in
                1984, and was quite shaken by the Gulf war, which sent him into temporary exile in Saudi Arabia. But Kuwait held elections last October, the reconvened Parliament is getting along
                well with the government, and Jaber is busy rebuilding his palace, which the Iraqis leveled.

                eligible bachelor, announced his pending merger with Melinda French, 28, a manager at his company. The happy couple will live on his three-acre estate, now abuilding, with enough
                bedrooms to ensure plenty of space for little dividends. But no word on how many Windows.

              <p xmlns="">
                13 WARREN EDWARD BUFFETT, 62 Omaha NEBRASKA $6.4 44% of Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett called it a ''nonevent'' when Berkshire's stock price rose above $10,000, screwing up the financial
                tables of newspapers that weren't programmed to print more than four digits. Said share would have cost you just $12 in 1965 if you'd had the foresight to see the words ''legendary
                investor'' stamped on Buffett's forehead.

                14 RONALD OWEN PERELMAN, 50 New York NEW YORK $5.9 MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings: 100% of Revlon, 82% of Coleman Cos., 80% of Marvel Entertainment Group, 21% of National Health
                Laboratories. Perelman has this billionaire stuff down. Two of his recent purchases were fantasy businesses: Consolidated Cigar -- he puffs H. Upmanns -- and more stock in Marvel, the

                90 MARC RICH, 58 Meggen SWITZERLAND $2.3 40% of Marc Rich &amp; Co., commodities trading; 53% of Sudelektra; investments; real estate. Survival is Rich's chief commodity. When there
                was dissension at his firm 18 months ago, he cut his holding back from a majority to 40%, admitted a younger generation of traders to partnership, and lured back his departed
                second-in-command, Willy Strothotte. Now Rich is coming up on his 11th year as a U.S. tax fugitive. Watch out, Marc. The proper gift for an 11th anniversary is steel -- as in
                handcuffs.

                91 GODTFRED KIRK KRISTIANSEN, 73 KJELD KIRK KRISTIANSEN, 46 Bilund DENMARK $2.2 100% of Lego Group. In an industry where today's success is tomorrow's Cabbage Patch doll, Lego
                building blocks just keep gaining popularity, brick by plastic brick. Last year 11 billion bricks were sold in more than 100 countries. Founded in the 1930s by Danish carpenter Ole
                Kirk Christiansen -- the name is now spelled with a K -- Lego (a contraction of leg godt, ''play well'') is run by his son and grandson.

                92 GEORGE P. LIVANOS New York NEW YORK $2.2 Seagroup, Unisea, Seres, and Ceres Hellenic shipping companies; cash. The owner of the largest Greek fleet is not resting on his trawlers.
                Ceres Hellenic has formed a partnership with Caspian Shipping, a newly independent Russian company, to build multipurpose bulk carriers. At a recent industry conference in Cyprus, the
                forward-looking Livanos envisioned a future when rockets would replace cargo ships.

                CBS Chairman Larry Tisch didn't get to take over London's huge Canary Wharf development, but he got just about everything else he wanted this year. CBS is once again high in the
                ratings, David Letterman signed on as a late-night host, and the network received $49.5 million worth of incentives from New York City and State to stay in Gotham. That should help
                pay Dave's gigamundo $14 million salary.

                94 HENRI ANDRE, 55 and family Prilly SWITZERLAND $2.1 Andre &amp; Cie.: agribusiness, commodity trading, tool manufacturing. The Andres live in a modest house in a blue-collar
                district. Few crumbs of information exist about grain czar Henri because his family is so secretive. Though Andre &amp; Cie. controls Garnac, one of the world's top five grain
                traders, the man responsible for most of the bread on Swiss tables will not publicly acknowledge owning it.

                Group: trades in steel, ores, fertilizers; oil; investment banking; chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Reputed to be the world's wealthiest Indian family, the four brothers
                expanded the Bombay company started in 1914 by their father, who traded teas, textiles, and spices in the Persian Gulf. Since the suicide a year ago of Srichand's son, the Hindujas
                have kept a low profile. But they have recently decided to talk more about their businesses because they want to tap capital markets and perhaps start a bank.

                96 MONGKOL KANJANAPAS, 72 ANANT KANJANAPAS, 51 KEREE KANJANAPAS, 43 Bangkok THAILAND $2.1 58% of Bangkok Land Co. Ltd; Seiko watch distribution; watch manufacturing in Hong Kong and
                Switzerland; financial services; cable television; urban transportation systems. The Kanjanapas fortunes took a beating in the recent slowdown of the Thai economy. Bangkok Land wound
                up selling some property rather than developing it, and the price of certain company shares fell by as much as 50%. But time, as in Seiko watches, may be on the brothers' side.

                Holdings PLC; Banco de Santiago; Cia. Cervercerias Unidas; Madeco, copper mining. Descended from Croatian immigrants, the Luksics are the Rumpelstiltskins of finance, spinning
                ordinary assets into gold. Witness their Chili-Bolivia Railway, which runs alongside Chile's copper mines. Or their copper mines themselves, now a handy source of telephone wire for
                their fledgling telecommunications network. Madeco will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in June.

                of the Minnesota Vikings football team. Many family businesses worry about succession, but few of them have sales of $47 billion. When Whitney, the great-grandson of founder W.W.
                Cargill, retires next year, a nonfamily member -- heavens! -- will likely be named CEO. That's the second time in 128 years that the company has been forced to turn to an outsider.
                Perhaps in preparation, the agribusiness has added five outside directors to the board. What is going on up there in Minnetonka, Minnesota?

                99 YASUO TAKEI, 63 and family Tokyo JAPAN $2.1 81.6% of Takefuji, one of Japan's largest consumer lending companies. When Japan's financial bubble burst, the banks were bruised. Not
                so Takefuji, which is experiencing double-digit revenue growth. It's still cheaper for consumers to borrow at Takefuji's dizzying 13.5% to 29% rates than to go to a bank that charges
                35%. The company's lending officers are also ready to listen. ''If a customer is not complaining,'' Takei says, ''he's started to do most of his business elsewhere.''

                100 BARON HANS-HEINRICH THYSSEN-BORNEMISZA DE KASZON, 72 Madrid SPAIN $2.1 100% of Thyssen-Bornemisza Group; art. Last year the baron lent 800 Old Master and impressionist paintings
                to the city of Madrid (hometown of fifth wife Tita). Now he appears ready to sell them to the Spanish government at a bargain price for the set -- an estimated $400 million. The rest
                of his collection remains in Villa Favorita, the Baron's Swiss residence. Managed by his daughter Francesca, something of a playgirl who recently married into the ancient Hapsburg
                dynasty, the villa is becoming a mecca for lovers of modern art.

                of Formosa Plastics Corp.; 10% of Formosa Taffeta. Ground is about to be broken on Y.C. Wang's long-awaited petrochemical complex (price tag: $3 billion) in southern Taiwan. Since the
                Taiwanese government wants to keep Wang's focus at home, it has nixed his plans for a similar complex in China. Y.C. hates to spend money on himself, so his wife sneaks new clothes
                into his closet.
