                (FORTUNE Magazine) &ndash; SULTAN HAJI HASSANAL BOLKIAH MU'IZZADDIN WADDAULAH, 46 and family Bandar Seri Begawan BRUNEI $37.0 Investments; global real estate; oil and gas fields. The
                Sultan of Brunei, 25 years on the throne of this tiny country that shares the island of Borneo with Maylasia and Indonesia, sure knows how to spend the world's biggest fortune.
                Practically everything in this petroleum-rich postage stamp belongs to him. Aside from the usual paintings and jewels, he also has the single-largest collection of Rolls-Royces: 153.
                But like many of his baby-boom contemporaries, the Sultan may be wondering if there's more to life than mere style. Hence, his third pilgrimage to Mecca -- most Moslems go only once
                in their lives -- last March.
              </p>

                HELEN R. WALTON, 72 Bentonville ARKANSAS S. ROBSON WALTON, 47 Bentonville ARKANSAS JOHN T. WALTON, 45 San Diego CALIFORNIA JAMES C. WALTON, 43 Bentonville ARKANSAS ALICE L. WALTON, 42
                Bentonville ARKANSAS $24.0 - 38% of Wal-Mart. The folksy merchant who revolutionized retailing, Mr. Sam was 44 when he opened his first Wal-Mart. But he had perfected his twin
                concepts of discounting and self-service at Ben Franklin, which he helped make the largest independent variety store operator in the U.S. With Mr. Sam gone, who will hover over
                traffic patterns in a small plane scouting potential Wal-Mart locations? Most likely his son Rob, the new chairman of Wal-Mart, or Jim, president of Walton Enterprises. But probably
                not John, who builds boats in San Diego, or Alice, who founded her investment banking firm, Llama Co., to provide capital for companies in overlooked areas of places like Arkansas and
                Oklahoma.

              <p xmlns="">
                TAIKICHIRO MORI, 88 and family Tokyo JAPAN $14.0 Mori Building Co.; real estate. The richest man in Japan started making all those yen leasing Western-style high rises in Tokyo after
                World War II. Mori, who lives modestly, is always mystified to appear on FORTUNE's billionaires list. ''I've seen on television how the billionaires in foreign countries live,'' he
                says. ''They all have such nice houses. So even if you say I'm the top billionaire in Japan, I find it just a little odd.''
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                FORREST MARS SR., 88 Las Vegas NEVADA FORREST MARS JR., 61 McLean VIRGINIA JOHN MARS, 56 McLean VIRGINIA JACQUELINE MARS VOGEL, 51 Bedminster NEW JERSEY $13.0 100% of Mars Inc:
                M&amp;M/Mars, Uncle Ben's Rice, Pedigree pet food, Mars Electronics. The members of the Mars clan run their business like they run their lives: somewhat eccentrically. Co-CEOs John
                and Forrest Jr. share a secretary, shun private offices, and punch in every morning. They even taste- test the dog food. Woof! Woof! Their father used to call his sons from his
                retirement quarters near Las Vegas to harangue them about their shortcomings as managers.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                SAMUEL I. NEWHOUSE JR., 64 DONALD E. NEWHOUSE, 62 and family New York NEW YORK $13.0 100% of Advance Publications and Newhouse Broadcasting. So reclusive that an employee reportedly
                once mistook him for the office carpenter, Si Newhouse can make his presence felt. Recently he exploded a bomb at the venerable New Yorker by bringing in a new editor, the spectacular
                Tina Brown of Vanity Fair. He manages the company's magazines and books while brother Don looks after the newspapers and broadcasting properties.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                QUEEN ELIZABETH II, 66 &lt; London ENGLAND $11.7 270,000 acres of agricultural land; premier London real estate; vast stock portfolio; art; jewelry; stamps; porcelain; furniture;
                racehorses. Oh, for the days when you could drown troublesome princes in a butt of malmsey! When the poor Queen is not dealing with her pouty first-born and his marital problems,
                she's having to face a second son and his. Worse, her billions and baubles are at risk with the Brits threatening to withdraw her tax-exempt status. But Liz could have the last laugh,
                skipping over troublesome Charles and handing her crown to young Prince Wills.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KING FAHD BIN ABDUL-AZIZ AL SAUD, 72 and family Riyadh SAUDI ARABIA $10.0 Saudi Arabia's oil and gas resources. King Fahd is known as a generous man, and has given millions to rebuild
                and restore the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. But at 72, in ill health and overweight, his recent munificence may also stem from a realization he doesn't have all that much time
                left.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                ANNE COX CHAMBERS, 72 Atlanta GEORGIA BARBARA COX ANTHONY, 69 Honolulu HAWAII $8.2 97% of Cox Enterprises. What is it about publishing dynasties? The ever richer Cox sisters, who also
                own a media company, appear to be female counterparts of the aloof Newhouse brothers. But Anne has always been interested in Democratic politics -- her father, James, was the 1920
                Democratic presidential candidate -- and is thought to be putting a few of her bucks behind Bill Clinton.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                JOHN WERNER KLUGE, 77 Charlottesville VIRGINIA $8.1 95% of Metromedia Co.; real estate; cash. No longer married to high-living playgirl Pat, Kluge seems to have dropped off the social
                pages. But he still figures in the business section, most recently when his pal Arthur B. Krim, the co-founder of Orion Pictures, asked him to save the prestigious but bankrupt movie
                studio. Kluge obliged, handing over $240 million for 70% of the company.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                GAD RAUSING, 70 London ENGLAND HANS RAUSING, 66 Sussex ENGLAND $7.2 100% of TetraPak, liquid-food packaging. The Rausings' tetrahedron-shaped liquid containers were the invention of
                the century until a competitor introduced a so-called biodegradable plastic pouch. Environmental legislation and this new product from their competitor have occupied Tetra's managers,
                but the 1991 merger with the Alfa Laval company, whose machines fill Tetra's containers, promises to help bolster Tetra's competitiveness.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                SHEIKH JABER AHMED AL SABAH, 66 and family KUWAIT $7.0 Vast foreign investments; real estate. Kuwait's treasury and Jaber's fortune are separate entities, which is a good thing for
                Jaber as his country tries to rebuild its Gulf war-torn infrastructure. But war has sure been hell for the Sheikh. When the Palestinians left Kuwait, he lost thousands of tenants for
                his apartments.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KENNETH R. THOMSON, 69 Toronto CANADA $6.2 71.1% of Thomson Corp., publishing; 73% of Hudson's Bay Co., department stores; 81.2% of Markborough Properties; art; real estate. Canada's
                richest man is a Depression-era kid who still carries his papers in a plastic bag. Says Thomson: ''My wife, Marilyn, gives me briefcases, but I'm a sucker for plastic bags. They do
                the job so well. I can still remember the Depression. I'm living better than most people. But I spend with my eyes open.''
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                WILLIAM GATES III, 36 Seattle WASHINGTON $5.9 30.5% of Microsoft. Yes, America's boy billionaire is still the U.S.'s most eligible bachelor. But he's hardly had time for a wife. The
                company he co- founded with Paul Allen (see below) just 17 years ago now has roughly the market value of GM, and in March the company announced its acquisition of Fox Software. Does
                Gates intend to dominate the database software market the way he does the operating systems software market?
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                RONALD OWEN PERELMAN, 49 New York NEW YORK $5.3 100% of MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings: Revlon, Coleman Cos., 21% of National Health Laboratories; 60% of Marvel Comics; 100% of
                First Gibraltar Bank. Ron Perelman is still trying to de-Eighties his balance sheet, selling some companies and taking others public. Ron and wife Claudia, whose marital problems are
                well publicized, keep confounding gossip columnists with their on-again, off-again union.

                Legend has it that Lawrence and Horace's father, Sir Elly, left Baghdad in 1880 and eventually went to Shanghai, where he began working as a clerk for distant relatives. When they
                objected to his using a barrel of disinfectant to wash down their offices during an epidemic, he quit, borrowed the equivalent of $80 from an uncle, and began investing. If
                cleanliness isn't next to godliness, it's way ahead of whatever is.

                Riyadh, where it brought a higher price. But the family is by no means modern. The bank's offices still use makeshift partitions and threadbare carpets, and the four brothers have

                the only way to make money was to treat their customers like royalty. But CEO Morton doesn't expect the same fealty from employees -- he has a windowless office, no executive parking
                space, and asks subordinates to call him Mort.

                on the door of the largest privately owned textile firm in the U.S. tends to turn you into a foe of free trade. Roger (a backer of Barry Goldwater and Strom Thurmond) once got the

                laws of economics. His low-debt media group effortlessly withstands the poor advertising climate even though the bulk of its assets are dailies -- the hardest hit of all print media.

                his personal fortune to be around $50 million. This figure might be accurate if he were referring only to the nest egg that his ancestor Mayer Amschel had in 1780. Besides, Edmond
                sure has some billionaire's hobbies: collecting Old Master paintings, tending multiple wineries, and producing Brie cheese.

                Munich real estate; mortgage banks. Rather than rack up billable hours, Schuppli used his legal training to found Deurag and subsequently invested the profits in real estate, banks,
                cutlery, and sewing machines. Unfortunately, the recession cut so deep into sewing machine sales that he's had to put off his retirement and lay off 500 Pfaff workers. Another 800 or

                from local projects into such international efforts as helping to build a hydroelectric dam in Iran. But not sure that it's ready for the 21st century yet, the company recently hired

                study economics in 1984, he didn't want to become the talk of Hamburg University. So he attempted anonymity by driving around in an old VW instead of his favored BMW. His new academic
                skills don't seem to be helping him in negotiations with Germany's privatization agency, though -- it agreed to sell him just one of the six East German newspapers he went after last
                year.

                to Nejat's apothecary father by the Izmir city assembly in 1909. Later the family simply adopted it as their surname. Nejat has dedicated himself to westernizing the Turkish

                than it was a year ago when their U.S. subsidiary, P.A. Bergner, overpaid for the debt-burdened Midwestern department store chain Carson Pirie Scott. The brothers, along with their
                partners and cousins the Nordmanns (see below), negotiated better loan conditions and are successfully reorganizing P.A. Bergner under Chapter 11. Selling their 42% stake in Au
                Printemps after speculators drove the stock price into the stratosphere didn't hurt either.
