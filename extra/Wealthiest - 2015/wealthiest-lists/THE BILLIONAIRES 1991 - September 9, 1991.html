                (FORTUNE Magazine) &ndash; SULTAN HAJI HASSANAL BOLKIAH MU'IZZADDIN WADDAULAH, 45 Bandar Seri Begawan BRUNEI $31.0 Oil and gas reserves; real estate around the world; investments. In
                tiny, tropical, oil-rich Brunei, what belongs to the state is controlled by the Sultan, the head of one of the earth's last absolute monarchies. An avid polo enthusiast, the world's
                richest man can afford air-conditioned stables for his ponies.

                SAM MOORE WALTON, 73 and family Bentonville ARKANSAS $21.1 39.3% of Wal-Mart. Last year, with sales of $32.6 billion, Wal-Mart outsold not just the mom and pop stores it's been
                putting out of business in small towns across America, but also retailing giant Sears, at least domestically. This performance really lifted the stock, making the Waltons America's
                richest family.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KING FAHD BIN ABDUL-AZIZ AL SAUD, 71 and family Riyadh SAUDI ARABIA $18.0 , Saudi Arabia's oil and gas resources. Fahd's windfall from pumping more oil during the Gulf crisis was
                offset by the many gifts he felt obliged to send Gulf leaders and other heads of state during that period. Still, with access to the entire Saudi treasury, the King is in no distress.
                His many palaces include a castle in Spain modeled after the White House -- but bigger.

                ALBERT REICHMANN, 63 PAUL REICHMANN, 62 RALPH REICHMANN, 59 Toronto CANADA $12.8 100% of Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.: European, Canadian, and American real estate;
                securities. Despite holding title to huge chunks of depressed New York real estate, having some $150 million tied up in unsecured Campeau Corp. debt, and having taken a big gamble on
                developing London's Canary Wharf office and retail complex, the Reichmanns are not hurting financially. The brothers' legendary thrift may have helped: They often pack their own
                lunches and sometimes ride Toronto's subway.

                FORREST MARS SR., 87 Las Vegas NEVADA FORREST MARS JR., 60 McLean VIRGINIA JOHN MARS, 55 McLean VIRGINIA JACQUELINE MARS VOGEL, 50 Bedminster NEW JERSEY $12.5 100% of Mars Inc:
                M&amp;M/Mars, Uncle Ben's Rice, Pedigree pet food, Mars Electronics. Last year, Americans ate more candy than ever: 21 pounds per person, up about a pound from 1989. The national
                sweet tooth is keeping the Mars family pocketbook pleasingly plump. Snickers still reigns as America's favorite chocolate, and peanut M&amp;Ms are in third place. While Forrest Sr.
                resides above the Nevada factory where the company makes a line of liqueur- filled chocolates, Forrest Jr. and John run the company; their sister, Jacqueline, rarely becomes involved
                with management.

              <p xmlns="">
                SAMUEL I. NEWHOUSE JR., 63 DONALD E. NEWHOUSE, 61 and family New York NEW YORK $12.1 100% of Advance Publications and Newhouse Broadcasting. Si is the guy who allowed Demi Moore's
                very pregnant belly to be bared on the cover of Vanity Fair. But neither the Newhouse family's celebrated Conde Nast magazines nor its tony Random House and Alfred A. Knopf book
                publishers supply most of the fuel for the family fortunes. That comes from 31 newspapers, ranging from the Newark Star-Ledger to the Oregonian in Portland, which bring in about twice
                the revenues of the attention-getting magazines and books.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                QUEEN ELIZABETH II, 65 London ENGLAND $10.7 270,000 acres of agricultural land; premier London real estate; vast stock portfolio; art; jewelry; stamps; porcelain; furniture;
                racehorses. When Elizabeth II disclosed last fall that the royal family spends $105,169 a year on laundry and $62,656 on flowers, not all of England was charmed. In a recent London
                Daily Mail survey, 38% of respondents said the monarchy is ''an expensive luxury the country could no longer afford,'' and 73% thought the royals should be taxed. Lese majesty!
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                TAIKICHIRO MORI, 87 Tokyo JAPAN $10.0 Mori Building Co., the third-largest building leasing company in Japan; real estate. Once a professor at a textile school, Mori admits he went
                into real estate development for the money. But he has since come to regard his work as public service and his mission as enhancing his city with his attractive office buildings.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                JOHN WERNER KLUGE, 76 Charlottesville VIRGINIA $7.1 95% of Metromedia Co.; real estate; cash. The German-born Kluge built Metromedia into a major independent television broadcaster,
                then sold most of the assets for nearly $3 billion in 1986 and started over. The ''new'' Metromedia owns properties spanning a majority interest in Orion Pictures to New York City's
                Empire Hotel. Kluge is starting over in his personal life too. He and his notorious ex-wife, Patricia, a former model for a British skin magazine, recently finalized what was said to
                be an amicable divorce. The sundered couple live just two miles apart on a 10,000-acre estate complete, it is said, with his and hers crypts.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KENNETH R. THOMSON, 68 Toronto CANADA $6.7 69.3% of Thomson Corp.; 76.3% of Hudson's Bay Co.; 80.56% of Markborough Properties; art; real estate. Neighbors speak fondly of Thomson,
                who stops them during strolls to talk about dogs. Fur traders speak less fondly of him, ever since the Thomson-controlled Hudson's Bay stores stopped selling fur last winter. An
                animal-rights activist, Thomson also controls Canada's second- largest newspaper chain, England's largest tour operator, and Britannia airways. His wife, Marilyn, cuts his hair.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                GERALD GROSVENOR, 39 and family Chester ENGLAND $6.6 Real estate holdings, including 300 acres in London's Mayfair and Belgravia areas, and commercial real estate in Hawaii, Chicago,
                Boston, and San Francisco. The Queen's former gynecologist came out of retirement to deliver Gerald Grosvenor's first son, Hugh, in January. Said Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of
                Westminster, on the occasion: ''Every father would like a boy. That's human nature.'' That's also English inheritance laws. Without little Hugh, the title ''Duke of Westminster''
                would have died with Grosvenor, who inherited his wealth from his father.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                CHUNG JU-YUNG, 75 and family Seoul KOREA $6.5 27.5% of Hyundai. With just a grade-school education, Chung has made a fortune in construction, heavy industry, and autos. Boldness
                rather than planning brought his success, and he has been especially aggressive overseas. Hyundai was the first Korean construction company to build bridges in Alaska, housing in
                Guam, and highways in Thailand.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                GAD RAUSING, 69 Sussex ENGLAND HANS RAUSING, 65 London ENGLAND $6.3 100% of TetraPak, liquid-food packaging. The Rausing brothers inherited the company from their father, inventor of
                a tetrahedron-shaped carton that revolutionized liquid-food packaging. Hans is now TetraPak chairman; Gad is vice chairman but now and then takes time off to give archaeology lectures
                at Sweden's University of Lund. Swedish by birth, both Rausings avoid exhorbitant taxes by living in England.
              </p>
              <p xmlns="">
                KENKICHI NAKAJIMA, 70 and family Kiryu JAPAN $5.6 80.9% of Heiwa, the world's largest maker of pachinko machines; real estate. ''Money is a traveler. Just when you get comfortable
                with it, it takes off,'' says Nakajima, a Japanese who left Korea for Japan as a teenager in 1937. The company he founded makes a pinball-like game popular with millions of
                overwrought businessmen who relax over a few rounds after work. How does Nakajima feel being one of the world's richest? ''I was delighted at first. Now I'm just used to it.''
                Hm-m-m-m-m-mm.

                Icahn raises again the age-old question: Do sharks suffer from indigestion? How else to explain why he sold his 13% USX holding just eight days after the company knuckled under to his
                demand to cleave itself into its energy and steel components. Now he has plans to reduce his stake in TWA to between 20% and 45% and file for bankruptcy to keep creditors at bay. His
                luck has been somewhat better at the racetrack -- he recently bet rap singer M.C. Hammer that his horse Meadow Star would beat Hammer's Lite Light. Icahn won the bet and collected
                $35,000.

                and, like others in his family, regards that budget as partly his own. A full brother to King Fahd, Prince Sultan keeps up the Arab tribal custom of regular majlis, whereby commoners
                may petition him for help in mundane matters or just drop by for a chat.
