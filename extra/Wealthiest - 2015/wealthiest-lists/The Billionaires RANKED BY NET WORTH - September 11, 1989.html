                (FORTUNE Magazine) &ndash; SULTAN HASSANAL BOLKIAH,43 Bandar Seri Begawan BRUNEI $25.0B Oil and gas; $20 billion in foreign investments. The 29th Sultan of Brunei presides over one of
                the smallest (pop. 240,000) and wealthiest nations in the world. He assumed the throne at 21 at his father's behest. Brunei, on the northwest coast of Borneo in the South China Sea,
                gained full independence from Britain in 1984. The Sultan often appears in a medaled uniform, but his main claim to fame was a $10 million donation to the Nicaraguan contras that
                wound up in the wrong Swiss bank account and became involved in the Iran- contra affair. Two wives, three sons, and six daughters.

                KING FAHD BIN ABDUL AZIZ AL SAUD, 69, and family Riyadh SAUDI ARABIA $18.0B The Saud family can draw at will on the kingdom's oil reserves.A moody king who feels more comfortable with
                the jet set than with the desert Saudis, Fahd is one of the Sudairi Seven, the seven favorite sons of King Abdul Aziz, founder of Saudi Arabia (he had 52 official sons and several
                wives). Their mother was Hassa bint Ahmed al Sudairi. Fahd is scheduled to visit Washington this month.

                Inc. Secretive descendants of company founder Frank Mars remain America's richest family. While the Mars clan openly detests press coverage (Forrest Sr. once sicked the cops on two
                Fortune reporters for calling him at home), Mars spends big bucks, an estimated $300 million last year alone, on advertising to keep the company's products near the minds and
                pocketbooks of consumers. The push pays dividends. Profits of Mars Inc. reached an estimated $780 million last year on sales of $8 billion. Forrest Sr., inventor of the Milky Way and
                Snickers bars, lives quietly atop his candy factory in Las Vegas, where he retired to start a new company, while his two brooding boys run the business. It also makes M&amp;M's, Uncle
                Ben's Rice, and Kal Kan pet food.

                QUEEN ELIZABETH II,63 London ENGLAND $10.9B Real estate, including Balmoral Castle in Scotland (50,000 acres), Sandringham House in Norfolk (20,000 acres); major property holdings in
                the U.S. and on the Continent; racehorses; jewelry; art, stamp, porcelain, and silver collections; vast shareholdings. Elizabeth, born third in line to the British throne, is the
                world's richest woman. Her pragmatic Majesty has invested wisely. The queen's stock portfolio increased in value 25% last year, and her art collection appreciated by 50%. She owns
                280,000 acres of land, including 350 in central London and virtually all the land around the coast of Britain, bringing in $73 million a year. She now turns that sum over to the
                Treasury and receives an annual payment ($7.3 million last year) from the Civil List.

                SAMUEL I. NEWHOUSE JR., 61 DONALD E. NEWHOUSE, 59 New York NEW YORK $10.0B 100% of Advance Publications and Newhouse Broadcasting. The sons of Sam Newhouse Sr., who left a media
                empire of 29 newspapers and five radio stations when he died in 1979, oversee a publishing and cable company whose holdings have leaped in value. Today the brothers control some 26
                daily newspapers -- including the Newark Star-Ledger and the Cleveland Plain Dealer -- as well as book publisher Random House, which has added Crown Publishing, Schocken Books, and
                Century Hutchinson to its stable, and more than 40 magazines, including the Conde Nast publications and the New Yorker.

                market, Cathay Life recently carried a price/earnings ratio of 206. The son of a poor rice farmer, Tsai Wan-lin and his older brother (who died in 1987) ran a fruit and vegetable
                stand as young men. Later they expanded into soy sauce manufacturing and branched out into diverse activities, including real estate, finance, construction, hotels, plastics, and
                more.

                called, opened his first discount store in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962. He took Wal-Mart public in 1970, and this year the company was voted America's most admired retailer in Fortune's
                annual survey. Average annual return to investors for the past five years: 36%. Annual dividends on the 220 million Wal-Mart shares Sam, his wife, Helen, and their four children own
                amount to $48 million. Down-to-earth Sam drives a pickup and loves to visit his stores.

                in Manhattan. They are building the $6 billion Canary Wharf project in London; strict Orthodox Jews, the Reichmanns are also putting up a $65 million civic center in Jerusalem. To
                escape the Nazis, they fled Austria for Tangier, then moved to Canada in 1956. Albert Reichmann spearheaded the effort to aid Armenians in the wake of the massive earthquake last
                December.

                outside Britain, and he's expanding in the States. Meanwhile Grosvenor, the sixth Duke of Westminster, has been none too popular with the folks closer to home, trying to prevent some
                of his tenants from exercising the right to buy their homes and ordering the people who live in Eaton Square to stop feeding the birds. In a more charitable vein, he's heading Prince
                Charles's new drive to help economically deprived villages.

                Field's); energy holdings; financial services; a distillery; real estate.His father, Roy, was a barber who bought his first radio station and newspaper in 1931. Roy pioneered an early
                version of the leveraged buyout in the 1940s by borrowing against the company's future profits to build a Canadian newspaper monopoly. He kept costs to a minimum by rationing even
                pencils and toilet paper, and by 1953 resettled in England as Lord Thomson of Fleet. The second Lord Thomson inherited the company as well as an acquisitive bent. He and wife Marilyn
                have three children, including 31-year-old heir apparent David. Owns the world's largest collection of paintings by Dutch-Canadian artist Cornelius Krieghoff.

              <p xmlns="">
                Estimates of net worth are based on published information or appraisals of asset values. To qualify, a prospect must have net worth -- total assets after subtracting debt -- of $1
                billion or more. For those with holdings in publicly traded companies, the value of their shares was computed using the closing price on July 17. Currency conversions into U.S.
                dollars were based on July 17 exchange rates. To determine the value of holdings in private companies, FORTUNE identified similar public companies, made reasonable adjustments for
                dissimilarities, and calculated a value based on the current market value of the public counterparts. In some cases we used prices paid for similar companies in recent takeovers or
                buyouts. Where data are lacking for ownership of shares in private companies, we used the best information available from persons knowledgeable about the companies and individuals
                involved. The list includes individuals or a ''nuclear'' family composed of husband and wife, parent and child, siblings, or some combination of those relationships. We tried to
                exclude cousins and in-laws, though when brothers and their children are involved in a business, the cousins obviously have a stake in a single fortune. We are indebted to our
                correspondents around the world. Among sources outside the Time and FORTUNE network were Japan -- Nikkei Venture magazine; Switzerland -- Rico Carisch, a correspondent for Bilanz
                magazine; Middle East -- Michael Field, a London business consultant and author of The Merchants. Data gathering was supervised by FORTUNE reporter Julianne Slovak, assisted by David
                Morrow, William Sheeline, Edward Baig, Gabrielle Solomon, and Rodney Erwin.
