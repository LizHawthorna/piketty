# Saudi prince sues Forbes after it says he's only worth $20 billion

Prince Alwaleed, nephew of the late Saudi King Abdullah, was unhappy with the Forbes 2013 estimation of his wealth, which ranked him 26th with £13billion.

Prince Alwaleed believed his investments in London's Savoy Hotel, Apple, Citigroup and News Corp had been undervalued.

According to the prince's calculations he should have been ranked at number ten with a £19.5billion fortune, right behind L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.

An official at the High Court in London confirmed that Prince Alwaleed had filed a defamation suit against Forbes, its editor Randall Lane, and two of its journalists on April 30.

This year's Forbes World Billionaires list was published on March 4, and the following day Kingdom Holding said the valuation process used "incorrect data" and "seemed designed to disadvantage Middle Eastern investors and institutions".
