BOX: WHAT LIES BEHIND THE NUMBERS

Estimates of net worth are based on published information or appraisals of asset values. To qualify, a prospect must have net worth -- total assets after subtracting debt -- of $1 billion or more. For those with holdings in publicly traded companies, the value of their shares was computed using the closing price on July 15. Currency conversions into U.S. dollars were based on July 15 exchange rates. To determine the value of holdings in private companies, FORTUNE identified similar public companies, made reasonable adjustments for dissimilarities, and calculated a value based on the current market value of the public counterparts. In some cases, we used prices paid for similar companies in recent takeovers or buyouts. Where data is lacking for ownership of shares in private companies, we used the best information available from persons knowledgeable about the companies and individuals involved. The list includes individuals or a ''nuclear'' family composed of husband and wife, parent and child, siblings, or some combination of those relationships. We tried to exclude cousins and in-laws, though when brothers and their children are involved in a business, the cousins obviously have a stake in a single fortune. We are indebted to our correspondents around the world. Among sources outside the Time Inc. network were Japan -- Nikkei Venture magazine; Switzerland -- Bilanz magazine; Middle East -- Michael Field, a London business consultant and author of The Merchants; Netherlands -- Jos R.M. van Hezewijk, CIDO databank, Uden; U.S. -- Wealth Monitors, an investment advisory firm.
