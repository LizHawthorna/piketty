### Reproduce
This website is based on the slidify framework. The source files are hosted on github and you may download the whole project as a zip file or fork it to a github repository in your account. To compile this website from the `.Rmd` source, configure the `site.yml` and run `blogify(".")` from the root of the folder hierarchy. Slidify will automatically detect all the `Rmd` files, slidify them, and create all lecture slides along with the index page. 

You will need the `slidify`, `slidifyLibraries`, ``rCharts`, and `poirot` packages.

    install.packages("devtools")  
    devtools::install_github(c("slidify", "slidifyLibraries", "rCharts", "poirot"), 
        "ramnathv", ref = "dev")  

In addition, I often use the following packages: ``ggplot2``, ``scales``, ``reshape2``, ``plyr``, so you may need to run this for each package:

    install.packages("ggplot2")

Write a short slide deck and publish it to [Github](http://www.github.com) with a few clicks using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com), with a single line of code.

### Layout

The `lectures` folder holds the lecture slides, one subfolder per lecture. The site's architecture looks like this:

```
assets      -> put custom img/js/css/layout assets
lectures    -> folder containing lectures
  Chapter 01
  Chapter 02
  Chapter 03
libraries   -> frameworks, highlighters and widgets
index.Rmd   -> Rmd source for home page
site.yml    -> Site related configuration
```
