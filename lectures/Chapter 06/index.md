### Introduction  

- Chapter 5 analyzes the capital/income ratio.  

- Chapter 6 analyzes the division of national income between labor and capital.  

- The first fundamental law of capitalism:  
$$
\alpha = r \times \beta
$$
gives a correspondence between the capital/income ratio and the division of income between labor and capital.

### Introduction

- For example, if the capital stock is equal to six years of national income ($\beta$ = 6), and if the average return on capital is 5 percent a year (r = 5%), then the share of income from capital $\alpha$ (as a percentage of national income) is 30 percent, and the share of income from labor is therefore 70 percent.  

- The central question is: How is the rate of return on capital determined?
