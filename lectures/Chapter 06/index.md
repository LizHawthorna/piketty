### Introduction  

- Chapter 5 analyzes the capital/income ratio.  

- Chapter 6 analyzes the division of national income between labor and capital.  

- The first fundamental law of capitalism:  
$$
\alpha = r \times \beta
$$
gives a correspondence between the capital/income ratio and the division of income between labor and capital.

### The First Fundamental Law of Capitalism

- The first fundamental law of capitalism gives a correspondence between the capital/income ratio and the division of income between labor and capital.  
- For example, if the capital stock is equal to six years of national income ($\beta$ = 6), and if the average return on capital is 5 percent a year (r = 5%), then the share of income from capital $\alpha$ (as a percentage of national income) is 30 percent, and the share of income from labor is therefore 70 percent.  

- The central question is: How is the rate of return on capital determined?

### Evolution of the Capital Income Share

- The capital income share $\alpha$ has followed a U-shaped curve similar to that of the capital/income ratio $\beta$, although the depth of the U is less pronounced.  
- Changes in the rate of return on capital $r$ have mitigated the evolution of the quantity of capital $\beta$:  
    - $r$ is higher in periods when $\beta$ is lower.  
    - $r$ is lower in periods when $\beta$ is higher.  
- The capital shares and rates of return are calculated by adding the various amounts of income from capital included in national accounts, including rents, profits, dividends, interest, royalties, etc., but excluding interest on public debt and excluding taxes.

### Capital Income Share and Capital/Income Ratio

- The capital income share $\alpha$ was about 35–40 percent in both Britain and France in the late 18th and throughout the 19th century.  
- In the middle of the 20th century $\alpha$ fell to 20–25 percent, then rose again to 25–30 percent in the late 20th and early 21st.  
- This corresponds to an average rate of return on capital $r$ of about 5–6 percent in the 18th and 19th centuries,  7–8 percent in the mid-20th century, 4–5 percent in the late 20th and early 21st.

### Capital Income Share and Capital/Income Ratio

- The yield on the riskiest assets (including industrial capital in the form of partnerships in family firms and shares of stock in listed corporations) is often greater than 7–8 percent.  
- The yield on less risky assets is about 4–5 percent for farmland in the 18th and 19th centuries and 3–4 percent for real estate in the early 21st century. 
- These are pre-tax returns.

### The Return on Capital in Historical Perspective
  

- There has been no pronounced long-term trend either upward or downward.  
- The pure return rose significantly above 6 percent following the massive destruction of property and numerous shocks to capital in the two world wars, but subsequently returned fairly rapidly to the lower levels observed in the past.
