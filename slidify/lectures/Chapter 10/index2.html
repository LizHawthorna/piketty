  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Let me turn now to the question of inequality of wealth and its historical evolution. The question is important, all the more so because the reduction of this type of inequality, and of the income derived from it, was the only reason why total income inequality diminished during the first half of the twentieth century. As noted, inequality of income from labor did not decrease in a structural sense between 1900–1910 and 1950–1960 in either France or the United States (contrary to the optimistic predictions of Kuznets’s theory, which was based on the idea of a gradual and mechanical shift of labor from worse paid to better paid types of work), and the sharp drop in total income inequality was due essentially to the collapse of high incomes from capital. All the information at our disposal indicates that the same is true for all the other developed countries.1 It is therefore essential to understand how and why this historic compression of inequality of wealth came about.
The question is all the more important because capital ownership is ap- parently becoming increasingly concentrated once again today, as the capital/ income ratio rises and growth slows. The possibility of a widening wealth gap raises many questions as to its long-term consequences. In some respects it is even more worrisome than the widening income gap between supermanagers and others, which to date remains a geographically limited phenomenon.</p>

    <h3>Hyperconcentrated Wealth: Europe and America</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>As noted in Chapter 7, the distribution of wealth—and therefore of income from capital—is always much more concentrated than the distribution of in- come from labor. In all known societies, at all times, the least wealthy half of the population own virtually nothing (generally little more than 5 percent of total wealth); the top decile of the wealth hierarchy own a clear majority of what there is to own (generally more than 60 percent of total wealth and sometimes as much as 90 percent); and the remainder of the population (by construction, the 40 percent in the middle) own from 5 to 35 percent of all wealth.2 I also noted the emergence of a “patrimonial middle class,” that is, an intermediate group who are distinctly wealthier than the poorer half of the population and own between a quarter and a third of national wealth. The emergence of this middle class is no doubt the most important structural transformation to affect the wealth distribution over the long run.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Why did this transformation occur? To answer this question, one must first take a closer look at the chronology. When and how did inequality of wealth begin to decline? To be candid, because the necessary sources (mainly probate records) are unfortunately not always available, I have thus far not been able to study the historical evolution of wealth inequality in as many countries as I examined in the case of income inequality. We have fairly com- plete historical estimates for four countries: France, Britain, the United States, and Sweden. The lessons of these four histories are fairly clear and consistent, however, so that we can say something about the similarities and differences between the European and US trajectories.3 Furthermore, the wealth data have one enormous advantage over the income data: they allow us in some cases to go much farther back in time. Let me now examine one by one the four countries I have studied in detail.</p>

    <h3>France: An Observatory of Private Wealth</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>France is a particularly interesting case, because it is the only country for which we have a truly homogeneous historical source that allows us to study the distribution of wealth continuously from the late eighteenth century to the present. In 1791, shortly after the fiscal privileges of the nobility were abol- ished, a tax on estates and gifts was established, together with a wealth regis- try. These were astonishing innovations at the time, notable for their univer- sal scope. The new estate tax was universal in three ways: first, it applied to all types of property: farmland, other urban and rural real estate, cash, public and private bonds, other kinds of financial assets such as shares of stock or partnerships, furniture, valuables, and so on; second, it applied to all owners of wealth, whether noble or common; and third, it applied to fortunes of all sizes, large or small. Moreover, the purpose of this fundamental reform was not only to fill the coffers of the new regime but also to enable the government to record all transfers of wealth, whether by bequest (at the owner’s death) or gift (during the owner’s lifetime), in order to guarantee to all the full exercise of their property rights. In official language, the estate and gift tax has always—from 1791 until now—been classified as one of a number of droits d’enregistrement (recording fees), and more specifically droits de mutation (transfer fees), which included both charges assessed on “free-will transfers,” or transfers of title to property made without financial consideration, by bequest or gift, and “transfers for consideration” (that is, transfers made in exchange for cash or other valuable tokens). The purpose of the law was thus to allow every property owner, large or small, to record his title and thus to enjoy his property rights in full security, including the right to appeal to the public au- thorities in case of difficulty. Thus a fairly complete system of property rec- ords was established in the late 1790s and early 1800s, including a cadastre for real estate that still exists today.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In Part Four I say more about the history of estate taxes in different countries. At this stage, taxes are of interest primarily as a historical source. In most other countries, it was not until the end of the nineteenth century or beginning of the twentieth that estate and gift taxes comparable to France’s were established. In Britain, the reform of 1894 unified previous taxes on the conveyance of real estate, financial assets, and personal estate, but homoge- neous probate statistics covering all types of property go back only to 1919–1920. In the United States, the federal tax on estates and gifts was not created until 1916 and covered only a tiny minority of the population. (Al- though taxes covering broader segments of the population do exist in some states, these are highly heterogeneous.) Hence it is very difficult to study the evolution of wealth inequalities in these two countries before World War I. To be sure, there are many probate documents and estate inventories, mostly of private origin, dealing with particular subsets of the population and types of property, but there is no obvious way to use these records to draw general conclusions.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This is unfortunate, because World War I was a major shock to wealth and its distribution. One of the primary reasons for studying the French case is precisely that it will allow us to place this crucial turning point in a longer historical perspective. From 1791 to 1901, the estate and gift tax was strictly proportional: it varied with degree of kinship but was the same regardless of the amount transferred and was usually quite low (generally 1–2 percent). The tax was made slightly progressive in 1901 after a lengthy parliamentary battle.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-11" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The government, which had begun publishing detailed statistics on the an- nual flow of bequests and donations as far back as the 1820s, began compiling a variety of statistics by size of estate in 1901, and from then until the 1950s, these became increasingly sophisticated (with cross-tabulations by age, size of estate, type of property, etc.). After 1970, digital files containing representa- tive samples from estate and gift tax filings in a specific year became available, so that the data set can be extended to 2000–2010. In addition to the rich sources produced directly by the tax authorities over the past two centuries, I have also collected, together with Postel-Vinay and Rosenthal, tens of thousands of individual declarations (which have been very carefully preserved in na- tional and departmental archives since the early nineteenth century) for the purpose of constructing large samples covering each decade from 1800–1810 to 2000–2010. All in all, French probate records offer an exceptionally rich and detailed view of two centuries of wealth accumulation and distribution.4</p>

    <h3>The Metamorphoses of a Patrimonial Society</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Figure 10.1 presents the main results I obtained for the evolution of the wealth distribution from 1810 to 2010.5 The first conclusion is that prior to the shocks of 1914–1945, there was no visible trend toward reduced inequality of capital ownership. Indeed, there was a slight tendency for capital concentration to rise throughout the nineteenth century (starting from an already very high level) and even an acceleration of the inegalitarian spiral in the period 1880– 1913. The top decile of the wealth hierarchy already owned between 80 and 85 percent of all wealth at the beginning of the nineteenth century; by the turn of the twentieth, it owned nearly 90 percent. The top centile alone owned 45– 50 percent of the nation’s wealth in 1800–1810; its share surpassed 50 percent in 1850–1860 and reached 60 percent in 1900–1910.6</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-13" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Looking at these data with the historical distance we enjoy today, we can- not help being struck by the impressive concentration of wealth in France during the Belle Époque, notwithstanding the reassuring rhetoric of the Third Republic’s economic and political elites. In Paris, which was home to little more than one-twentieth of the population in 1900–1910 but claimed one-quarter of the wealth, the concentration of wealth was greater still and seems to have increased without limit during the decades leading up to World War I. In the capital, where in the nineteenth century two-thirds of the population died without any wealth to leave to the next generation (com- pared with half of the population in the rest of the country) but where the largest fortunes were also concentrated, the top centile’s share was about 55 percent at the beginning of the century, rose to 60 percent in 1880–1890, and then to 70 percent on the eve of World War I (see Figure 10.2). Looking at this curve, it is natural to ask how high the concentration of wealth might have gone had there been no war.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-14" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The probate records also allow us to see that throughout the nineteenth century, wealth was almost as unequally distributed within each age cohort as in the nation as a whole. Note that the estimates indicated in Figures 10.1–2 (and subsequent figures) reflect inequality of wealth in the (living) adult pop- ulation at each charted date: we start with wealth at the time of death but re- weight each observation as a function of the number of living individuals in each age cohort as of the date in question. In practice, this does not make much difference: the concentration of wealth among the living is barely a few points higher than inequality of wealth at death, and the temporal evolution is nearly identical in each case.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-15" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>How concentrated was wealth in France during the eighteenth century up to the eve of the Revolution? Without a source comparable to the probate rec- ords created by the revolutionary assemblies (for the Ancien Régime we have only heterogeneous and incomplete sets of private data, as for Britain and the United States until the late nineteenth century), it is unfortunately impossi- ble to make precise comparisons. Yet all signs are that inequality of private wealth decreased slightly between 1780 and 1810 owing to redistribution of agricultural land and cancellation of public debt during the Revolution, to- gether with other shocks to aristocratic fortunes. It is possible that the top decile’s share attained or even slightly exceeded 90 percent of total wealth on the eve of 1789 and that the upper centile’s share attained or exceeded 60 per- cent. Conversely, the “émigré billion” (the billion francs paid to the nobility in compensation for land confiscated during the Revolution) and the return of the nobility to the forefront of the political scene contributed to the recon- stitution of some old fortunes during the period of limited-suffrage monarchy (1815–1848). In fact, our probate data reveal that the percentage of aristocratic names in the top centile of the Parisian wealth hierarchy increased gradually from barely 15 percent in 1800–1810 to nearly 30 percent in 1840–1850 before embarking on an inexorable decline from 1850–1860 on, falling to less than 10 percent by 1890–1900.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-16" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The magnitude of the changes initiated by the French Revolution should not be overstated, however. Beyond the probable decrease of inequality of wealth between 1780 and 1810, followed by a gradual increase between 1810 and 1910, and especially after 1870, the most significant fact is that inequality of capital ownership remained relatively stable at an extremely high level throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. During this period, the top decile consistently owned 80 to 90 percent of total wealth and the top centile 50 to 60 percent. As I showed in Part Two, the structure of capi- tal was totally transformed between the eighteenth century and the begin- ning of the twentieth century (landed capital was almost entirely replaced by industrial and financial capital and real estate), but total wealth, measured in years of national income, remained relatively stable. In particular, the French Revolution had relatively little effect on the capital/income ratio. As just shown, the Revolution also had relatively little effect on the distribution of wealth. In 1810–1820, the epoch of Père Goriot, Rastignac, and Mademoi- selle Victorine, wealth was probably slightly less unequally distributed than during the Ancien Régime, but the difference was really rather minimal: both before and after the Revolution, France was a patrimonial society char- acterized by a hyperconcentration of capital, in which inheritance and mar- riage played a key role and inheriting or marrying a large fortune could pro- cure a level of comfort not obtainable through work or study. In the Belle Époque, wealth was even more concentrated than when Vautrin lectured Rastignac. At bottom, however, France remained the same society, with the same basic structure of inequality, from the Ancien Régime to the Third Republic, despite the vast economic and political changes that took place in the interim.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-17" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Probate records also enable us to observe that the decrease in the upper decile’s share of national wealth in the twentieth century benefited the middle 40 percent of the population exclusively, while the share of the poorest 50 percent hardly increased at all (it remained less than 5 percent of total wealth). Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the bot- tom half of the population had virtually zero net wealth. In particular, we find that at the time of death, individuals in the poorest half of the wealth distribution owned no real estate or financial assets that could be passed on to heirs, and what little wealth they had went entirely to expenses linked to death and to paying off debts (in which case the heirs generally chose to re- nounce their inheritance). The proportion of individuals in this situation at the time of death exceeded two-thirds in Paris throughout the nineteenth century and until the eve of World War I, and there was no downward trend. Père Goriot belonged to this vast group, dying as he did abandoned by his daughters and in abject poverty: his landlady, Madame Vauquer, dunned Rastignac for what the old man owed her, and he also had to pay the cost of burial, which exceeded the value of the deceased’s meager per- sonal effects. Roughly half of all French people in the nineteenth century died in similar circumstances, without any wealth to convey to heirs, or with only negative net wealth, and this proportion barely budged in the twentieth century.</p>

    <p>In Britain, we have detailed probate data from 1910–1920 on, and these records have been exhaustively studied by many investigators (most notably Atkinson and Harrison). If we complete these statistics with estimates from recent years as well as the more robust but less homogeneous estimates that Peter Linder has made for the period 1810–1870 (based on samples of estate inventories), we find that the overall evolution was very similar to the French case, although the level of inequality was always somewhat greater in Britain. The top decile’s share of total wealth was on the order of 85 percent from 1810 to 1870 and surpassed 90 percent in 1900–1910; the uppermost centile’s share rose from 55–60 percent in 1810–1870 to nearly 70 percent in 1910–1920 (see Figure 10.3). The British sources are imperfect, especially for the nineteenth century, but the orders of magnitude are quite clear: wealth in Britain was extremely concentrated in the nineteenth century and showed no tendency to decrease before 1914. From a French perspective, the most striking fact is that inequality of capital ownership was only slightly greater in Britain than in France during the Belle Époque, even though Third Republic elites at the time liked to portray France as an egalitarian country compared with its monarchical neighbor across the Channel. In fact, the formal nature of the political regime clearly had very little influence on the distribution of wealth in the two countries.</p>

    <p>In Sweden, where the very rich data available from 1910, of which Ohl- sonn, Roine, and Waldenstrom have recently made use, and for which we also have estimates for the period 1810–1870 (by Lee Soltow in particular), we find a trajectory very similar to what we observed in France and Britain (see Figure 10.4). Indeed, the Swedish wealth data confirm what we already know from income statements: Sweden was not the structurally egalitarian country that we sometimes imagine. To be sure, the concentration of wealth in Sweden in 1970–1980 attained the lowest level of inequality observed in any of our his- torical series (with barely 50 percent of total wealth owned by the top decile and slightly more than 15 percent by the top centile). This is still a fairly high level of inequality, however, and, what is more, inequality in Sweden has in- creased significantly since 1980–1990 (and in 2010 was just slightly lower than in France). It is worth stressing, moreover, that Swedish wealth was as concentrated as French and British wealth in 1900–1910. In the Belle Époque, wealth was highly concentrated in all European countries. It is essential to under- stand why this was so, and why things changed so much over the course of the twentieth century.</p>

    <p>Note, moreover, that we also find the same extremely high concentration of wealth—with 80 to 90 percent of capital owned by the top decile and 50– 60 percent by the top centile—in most societies prior to the nineteenth cen- tury, and in particular in traditional agrarian societies in the modern era, as well as in the Middle Ages and antiquity. The available sources are not suffi- ciently robust to permit precise comparisons or study temporal evolutions, but the orders of magnitude obtained for the shares of the top decile and centile in total wealth (and especially in total farmland) are generally close to what we find in France, Britain, and Sweden in the nineteenth century and Belle Époque.</p>

    <h3>The Emergence of the Patrimonial Middle Class</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Three questions will concern us in the remainder of this chapter. Why were inequalities of wealth so extreme, and increasing, before World War I? And why, despite the fact that wealth is once again prospering at the beginning of the twenty-first century as it did at the beginning of the twentieth century (as the evolution of the capital/income ratio shows), is the concentration of wealth today significantly below its historical record high? Finally, is this state of affairs irreversible?</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-23" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In fact, the second conclusion that emerges very clearly from the French data presented in Figure 10.1 is that the concentration of wealth, as well as the concentration of income from wealth, has never fully recovered from the shocks of 1914–1945. The upper decile’s share of total wealth, which attained 90 percent in 1910–1920, fell to 60–70 percent in 1950–1970; the upper cen- tile’s share dropped even more precipitously, from 60 percent in 1910–1920 to 20–30 percent in 1950–1970. Compared with the trend prior to World War I, the break is clear and overwhelming. To be sure, inequality of wealth began to increase again in 1980–1990, and financial globalization has made it more and more difficult to measure wealth and its distribution in a national framework: inequality of wealth in the twenty-first century will have to be gauged more and more at the global level. Despite these uncertainties, however, there is no doubt that inequality of wealth today stands significantly below its level of a century ago: the top decile’s share is now around 60–65 percent, which, though still quite high, is markedly below the level attained in the Belle Époque. The essential difference is that there is now a patrimonial middle class, which owns about a third of national wealth—a not insignificant amount.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The available data for the other European countries confirm that this has been a general phenomenon. In Britain, the upper decile’s share fell from more than 90 percent on the eve of World War I to 60–65 percent in the 1970s; it is currently around 70 percent. The top centile’s share collapsed in the wake of the twentieth century’s shocks, falling from nearly 70 percent in 1910–1920 to barely more than 20 percent in 1970–1980, then rising to 25–30 percent today (see Figure 10.3). In Sweden, capital ownership was always less concentrated than in Britain, but the overall trajectory is fairly similar (see Figure 10.4). In every case, we find that what the wealthiest 10 percent lost mainly benefited the “patrimonial middle class” (defined as the middle 40 percent of the wealth hierarchy) and did not go to the poorest half of the population, whose share of total wealth has always been minuscule (generally around 5 percent), even in Sweden (where it was never more than 10 percent). In some cases, such as Brit- ain, we find that what the richest 1 percent lost also brought significant gains to the next lower 9 percent. Apart from such national specificities, however, the general similarity of the various European trajectories is quite striking. The major structural transformation was the emergence of a middle group, repre- senting nearly half the population, consisting of individuals who managed to acquire some capital of their own—enough so that collectively they came to own one-quarter to one-third of the nation’s total wealth.</p>

    <h3>Inequality of Wealth in America</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>I turn now to the US case. Here, too, we have probate statistics from 1910– 1920 on, and these have been heavily exploited by researchers (especially Lamp- man, Kopczuk, and Saez). To be sure, there are important caveats associated with the use of these data, owing to the small percentage of the population covered by the federal estate tax. Nevertheless, estimates based on the probate data can be supplemented by information from the detailed wealth surveys that the Federal Reserve Bank has conducted since the 1960s (used notably by Arthur Kennickell and Edward Wolff), and by less robust estimates for the period 1810–1870 based on estate inventories and wealth census data exploited respectively by Alice Hanson Jones and Lee Soltow.</p>

    <p>Several important differences between the European and US trajectories stand out. First, it appears that inequality of wealth in the United States around 1800 was not much higher than in Sweden in 1970–1980. Since the United States was a new country whose population consisted largely of immigrants who came to the New World with little or no wealth, this is not very surpris- ing: not enough time had passed for wealth to be accumulated or concen- trated. The data nevertheless leave much to be desired, and there is some varia- tion between the northern states (where estimates suggest a level of inequality lower than that of Sweden in 1970–1980) and southern states (where inequal- ity was closer to contemporary European levels).</p>

    <p>It is a well-established fact that wealth in the United States became increas- ingly concentrated over the course of the nineteenth century. In 1910, capital inequality there was very high, though still markedly lower than in Europe: the top decile owned about 80 percent of total wealth and the top centile around 45 percent (see Figure 10.5). Interestingly, the fact that inequality in the New World seemed to be catching up with inequality in old Europe greatly worried US economists at the time. Willford King’s book on the distribution of wealth in the United States in 1915—the first broad study of the question—is particularly illuminating in this regard. </p>

<slide class="" id="slide-28" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>From today’s perspective, this may seem surprising: we have been accustomed for several decades now to the fact that the United States is more inegalitarian than Europe and even that many Americans are proud of the fact (often arguing that inequality is a prerequisite of entrepreneurial dynamism and decrying Europe as a sanctuary of Soviet- style egalitarianism). A century ago, however, both the perception and the re- ality were strictly the opposite: it was obvious to everyone that the New World was by nature less inegalitarian than old Europe, and this difference was also a subject of pride. In the late nineteenth century, in the period known as the Gilded Age, when some US industrialists and financiers (for example John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan) accumulated unprecedented wealth, many US observers were alarmed by the thought that the country was losing its pioneering egalitarian spirit. To be sure, that spirit was partly a myth, but it was also partly justified by comparison with the concentration of wealth in Europe. In Part Four we will see that this fear of growing to resemble Eu- rope was part of the reason why the United States in 1910–1920 pioneered a very progressive estate tax on large fortunes, which were deemed to be incom- patible with US values, as well as a progressive income tax on incomes thought to be excessive. Perceptions of inequality, redistribution, and national identity changed a great deal over the course of the twentieth century, to put it mildly.</p>

    <p>Inequality of wealth in the United States decreased between 1910 and 1950, just as inequality of income did, but much less so than in Europe: of course it started from a lower level, and the shocks of war were less violent. By 2010, the top decile’s share of total wealth exceeded 70 percent, and the top centile’s share was close to 35 percent.</p>

<p>In the end, the deconcentration of wealth in the United States over the course of the twentieth century was fairly limited: the top decile’s share of total wealth dropped from 80 to 70 percent, whereas in Europe it fell from 90 to 60 percent (see Figure 10.6).</p>

    <p>The differences between the European and US experiences are clear. In Europe, the twentieth century witnessed a total transformation of society: inequality of wealth, which on the eve of World War I was as great as it had been under the Ancien Régime, fell to an unprecedentedly low level, so low that nearly half the population were able to acquire some measure of wealth and for the first time to own a significant share of national capital. This is part of the explanation for the great wave of enthusiasm that swept over Europe in the period 1945–1975. People felt that capitalism had been overcome and that inequality and class society had been relegated to the past. It also explains why Europeans had a hard time accepting that this seemingly ineluctable social progress ground to a halt after 1980, and why they are still wondering when the evil genie of capitalism will be put back in its bottle.</p>

    <p>In the United States, perceptions are very different. In a sense, a (white) patrimonial middle class already existed in the nineteenth century. It suffered a setback during the Gilded Age, regained its health in the middle of the twentieth century, and then suffered another setback after 1980. This “yo-yo” pattern is reflected in the history of US taxation. In the United States, the twentieth century is not synonymous with a great leap forward in social jus- tice. Indeed, inequality of wealth there is greater today than it was at the be- ginning of the nineteenth century. Hence the lost US paradise is associated with the country’s beginnings: there is nostalgia for the era of the Boston Tea Party, not for Trente Glorieuses and a heyday of state intervention to curb the excesses of capitalism.</p>

    <h3>The Mechanism of Wealth Divergence: r versus g in History</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Let me try now to explain the observed facts: the hyperconcentration of wealth in Europe during the nineteenth century and up to World War I; the substantial compression of wealth inequality following the shocks of 1914– 1945; and the fact that the concentration of wealth has not—thus far— regained the record heights set in Europe in the past.</p>

<p>Several mechanisms may be at work here, and to my knowledge there is no evidence that would allow us to determine the precise share of each in the overall movement. We can, however, try to hierarchize the different mecha- nisms with the help of the available data and analyses. Here is the main con- clusion that I believe we can draw from what we know.</p>

<p>The primary reason for the hyperconcentration of wealth in traditional agrarian societies and to a large extent in all societies prior to World War I (with the exception of the pioneer societies of the New World, which are for obvious reasons very special and not representative of the rest of the world or the long run) is that these were low-growth societies in which the rate of re- turn on capital was markedly and durably higher than the rate of growth.</p>

  </article>

<slide class="" id="slide-33" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>This fundamental force for divergence, which I discussed briefly in the Introduction, functions as follows. Consider a world of low growth, on the or- der of, say, 0.5–1 percent a year, which was the case everywhere before the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The rate of return on capital, which is generally on the order of 4 or 5 percent a year, is therefore much higher than the growth rate. Concretely, this means that wealth accumulated in the past is recapitalized much more quickly than the economy grows, even when there is no income from labor.</p>

  </article>
  <!-- Presenter Notes -->
</slide>

<slide class="" id="slide-34" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>For example, if g = 1% and r = 5%, saving one-fifth of the income from capital (while consuming the other four-fifths) is enough to ensure that capi- tal inherited from the previous generation grows at the same rate as the econ- omy. If one saves more, because one’s fortune is large enough to live well while consuming somewhat less of one’s annual rent, then one’s fortune will in- crease more rapidly than the economy, and inequality of wealth will tend to increase even if one contributes no income from labor. For strictly mathemat- ical reasons, then, the conditions are ideal for an “inheritance society” to prosper—where by “inheritance society” I mean a society characterized by both a very high concentration of wealth and a significant persistence of large for- tunes from generation to generation.</p>

  </article>
  <!-- Presenter Notes -->
</slide>

<slide class="" id="slide-35" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Now, it so happens that these conditions existed in any number of societies throughout history, and in particular in the European societies of the nine- teenth century. As Figure 10.7 shows, the rate of return on capital was signifi- cantly higher than the growth rate in France from 1820 to 1913, around 5 per- cent on average compared with a growth rate of around 1 percent. Income from capital accounted for nearly 40 percent of national income, and it was enough to save one-quarter of this to generate a savings rate on the order of 10 percent (see Figure 10.8). This was sufficient to allow wealth to grow slightly more rapidly than income, so that the concentration of wealth trended upward. In the next chapter I will show that most wealth in this period did come from inheritance, and this supremacy of inherited capital, despite the period’s great economic dynamism and impressive financial sophistication, is explained by the dynamic effects of the fundamental inequality r &gt; g: the very rich French probate data allow us to be quite precise about this point.</p>

    <h3>Why Is the Return on Capital Greater Than the Growth Rate?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Let me pursue the logic of the argument. Are there deep reasons why the re- turn on capital should be systematically higher than the rate of growth? To be clear, I take this to be a historical fact, not a logical necessity.
It is an incontrovertible historical reality that r was indeed greater than g over a long period of time. Many people, when first confronted with this claim, express astonishment and wonder why it should be true. The most ob- vious way to convince oneself that r &gt; g is indeed a historical fact is no doubt the following.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-37" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>As I showed in Part One, economic growth was virtually nil throughout much of human history: combining demographic with economic growth, we can say that the annual growth rate from antiquity to the seventeenth century never exceeded 0.1–0.2 percent for long. Despite the many historical uncer- tainties, there is no doubt that the rate of return on capital was always consid- erably greater than this: the central value observed over the long run is 4–5 percent a year. In particular, this was the return on land in most traditional agrarian societies. Even if we accept a much lower estimate of the pure yield on capital—for example, by accepting the argument that many landowners have made over the years that it is no simple matter to manage a large estate, so that this return actually reflects a just compensation for the highly skilled labor contributed by the owner—we would still be left with a minimum (and to my mind unrealistic and much too low) return on capital of at least 2–3 percent a year, which is still much greater than 0.1–0.2 percent. Thus through- out most of human history, the inescapable fact is that the rate of return on capital was always at least 10 to 20 times greater than the rate of growth of output (and income). Indeed, this fact is to a large extent the very foundation of society itself: it is what allowed a class of owners to devote themselves to something other than their own subsistence.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-38" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In order to illustrate this point as clearly as possible, I have shown in Figure 10.9 the evolution of the global rate of return on capital and the growth rate from antiquity to the twenty-first century. </p>

<p>These are obviously approximate and uncertain estimates, but the orders of magnitude and overall evolutions may be taken as valid. For the global growth rate, I have used the historical estimates and projections discussed in Part One. For the global rate of return on capital, I have used the estimates for Britain and France in the period 1700–2010, which were analyzed in Part Two. For early periods, I have used a pure return of 4.5 percent, which should be taken as a minimum value (available historical data suggest average returns on the order of 5–6 percent).16 For the twenty-first century, I have assumed that the value observed in the period 1990–2010 (about 4 percent) will con- tinue, but this is of course uncertain: there are forces pushing toward a lower return and other forces pushing toward a higher. Note, too, that the returns on capital in Figure 10.8 are pretax returns (and also do not take account of capital losses due to war, or of capital gains and losses, which were especially large in the twentieth century).</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-39" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>As Figure 10.9 shows, the pure rate of return on capital—generally 4–5 percent—has throughout history always been distinctly greater than the global growth rate, but the gap between the two shrank significantly during the twentieth century, especially in the second half of the century, when the global economy grew at a rate of 3.5–4 percent a year. In all likelihood, the gap will widen again in the twenty-first century as growth (especially demographic growth) slows. According to the central scenario discussed in Part One, global growth is likely to be around 1.5 percent a year between 2050 and 2100, roughly the same rate as in the nineteenth century. The gap between r and g would then return to a level comparable to that which existed during the In- dustrial Revolution.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In such a context, it is easy to see that taxes on capital—and shocks of vari- ous kinds—can play a central role. Before World War I, taxes on capital were very low (most countries did not tax either personal income or corporate prof- its, and estate taxes were generally no more than a few percent). To simplify matters, we may therefore assume that the rate of return on capital was virtu- ally the same after taxes as before. After World War I, the tax rates on top in- comes, profits, and wealth quickly rose to high levels. Since the 1980s, how- ever, as the ideological climate changed dramatically under the influence of financial globalization and heightened competition between states for capital, these same tax rates have been falling and in some cases have almost entirely disappeared.</p>

  <!-- Presenter Notes -->

<slide class="" id="slide-41" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Figure 10.10 shows my estimates of the average return on capital after taxes and after accounting for estimated capital losses due to destruction of prop- erty in the period 1913–1950. For the sake of argument, I have also assumed that fiscal competition will gradually lead to total disappearance of taxes on capital in the twenty-first century: the average tax rate on capital is set at 30 percent for 1913–2012, 10 percent for 2012–2050, and 0 percent in 2050–2100. Of course, things are more complicated in practice: taxes vary enormously, depending on the country and type of property. At times, they are progressive (meaning that the tax rate increases with the level of income or wealth, at least in theory), and obviously it is not foreordained that fiscal competition must proceed to its ultimate conclusion.</p>

  </article>
  <!-- Presenter Notes -->
</slide>

<slide class="" id="slide-42" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Under these assumptions, we find that the return on capital, net of taxes (and losses), fell to 1–1.5 percent in the period 1913–1950, which was less than the rate of growth. This novel situation continued in the period 1950–2012 owing to the exceptionally high growth rate. Ultimately, we find that in the twentieth century, both fiscal and nonfiscal shocks created a situation in which, for the first time in history, the net return on capital was less than the growth rate. A concatenation of circumstances (wartime destruction, progressive tax policies made possible by the shocks of 1914– 1945, and exceptional growth during the three decades following the end of World War II) thus created a historically unprecedented situation, which lasted for nearly a century. All signs are, however, that it is about to end. If fiscal competition proceeds to its logical conclusion—which it may—the gap between r and g will return at some point in the twenty-first century to a level close to what it was in the nineteenth century (see Figure 10.10). If the average tax rate on capital stays at around 30 percent, which is by no means certain, the net rate of return on capital will most likely rise to a level significantly above the growth rate, at least if the central scenario turns out to be correct.</p>

  </article>

<slide class="" id="slide-43" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To bring this possible evolution out even more clearly, I have combined in Figure 10.11 the two subperiods 1913–1950 and 1950–2012 into a single average for the century 1913–2012, the unprecedented era during which the net rate of return on capital was less than the growth rate. I have also combined the two subperiods 2012–2050 and 2050–2100 into a single average for 2012– 2100 and assumed that the rates for the second half of the twenty-first cen- tury would continue into the twenty-second century (which is of course by no means guaranteed). In any case, Figure 10.11 at least brings out the unprecedented—and possibly unique—character of the twentieth century in regard to the relation between r and g. Note, too, that the hypothesis that global growth will continue at a rate of 1.5 percent a year over the very long run is regarded as excessively optimistic by many observers. Recall that the average growth of global per capita output was 0.8 percent a year between 1700 and 2012, and demographic growth (which also averaged 0.8 percent a year over the past three centuries) is expected to drop sharply between now and the end of the twenty-first century (according to most forecasts). Note, however, that the principal shortcoming of Figure 10.11 is that it relies on the assumption that no significant political reaction will alter the course of capitalism and financial globalization over the course of the next two cen- turies. Given the tumultuous history of the past century, this is a dubious and to my mind not very plausible hypothesis, precisely because its inegali- tarian consequences would be considerable and would probably not be tol- erated indefinitely.</p>

    <p>To sum up: the inequality r &gt; g has clearly been true throughout most of human history, right up to the eve of World War I, and it will probably be true again in the twenty-first century. Its truth depends, however, on the shocks to which capital is subject, as well as on what public policies and institutions are put in place to regulate the relationship between capital and labor.</p>

    <h3>The Question of Time Preference</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To recap: the inequality r &gt; g is a contingent historical proposition, which is true in some periods and political contexts and not in others. From a strictly logical point of view, it is perfectly possible to imagine a society in which the growth rate is greater than the return on capital—even in the absence of state intervention. Everything depends on the one hand on technology (what is capital used for?) and on the other on attitudes toward saving and property (why do people choose to hold capital?). As noted, it is perfectly possible to imagine a society in which capital has no uses (other than to serve as a pure store of value, with a return strictly equal to zero), but in which people would choose to hold a lot of it, in anticipation, say, of some future catastrophe or grand potlatch or simply because they are particularly patient and take a gen- erous attitude toward future generations. If, moreover, productivity growth in this society is rapid, either because of constant innovation or because the country is rapidly catching up with more technologically advanced countries, then the growth rate may very well be distinctly higher than the rate of return on capital.</p>

  </article>
  <!-- Presenter Notes -->
</slide>

<slide class="" id="slide-46" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In practice, however, there appears never to have been a society in which the rate of return on capital fell naturally and persistently to less than 2–3 percent, and the mean return we generally see (averaging over all types of investments) is generally closer to 4–5 percent (before taxes). In particular, the return on agricultural land in traditional societies, like the return on real estate in today’s societies—these being the most common and least risky forms of investment in each case—is generally around 4–5 percent, with perhaps a slight downward trend over the very long run (to 3–4 percent rather than 4–5).
The economic model generally used to explain this relative stability of the return on capital at around 4–5 percent (as well as the fact that it never falls below 2–3 percent) is based on the notion of “time preference” in favor of the present. In other words, economic actors are characterized by a rate of time preference (usually denoted θ) that measures how impatient they are and how they take the future into account. </p>

<slide class="" id="slide-47" style="background:;">

    <p>For example, if θ = 5 percent, the actor in question is prepared to sacrifice 105 euros of consumption tomorrow in order to consume an additional 100 euros today. This “theory,” like many theoreti- cal models in economics, is somewhat tautological (one can always explain any observed behavior by assuming that the actors involved have preferences— or “utility functions” in the jargon of the profession—that lead them to act that way), and its predictive power is radical and implacable. In the case in point, assuming a zero-growth economy, it is not surprising to discover that the rate of return on capital must equal the time preference θ.17 According to this theory, the reason why the return on capital has been historically stable at 4–5 percent is ultimately psychological: since this rate of return reflects the average person’s impatience and attitude toward the future, it cannot vary much from this level.</p>

    <p>In addition to being tautological, the theory raises a number of other dif- ficulties. To be sure, the intuition that lies behind the model (like that which lies behind marginal productivity theory) cannot be entirely wrong. All other things equal, a more patient society, or one that anticipates future shocks, will of course amass greater reserves and accumulate more capital. Similarly, if a society accumulates so much capital that the return on capital is persistently low, say, 1 percent a year (or in which all forms of wealth, including the prop- erty of the middle and lower classes, are taxed so that the net return is very low), then a significant proportion of property-owning individuals will seek to sell their homes and financial assets, thus decreasing the capital stock until the yield rises.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The problem with the theory is that it is too simplistic and systematic: it is impossible to encapsulate all savings behavior and all attitudes toward the future in a single inexorable psychological parameter. If we take the most extreme version of the model (called the “infinite horizon” model, because agents calculate the consequences of their savings strategy for all their descen- dants until the end of time as though they were thinking of themselves, in accordance with their own rate of time preference), it follows that the net rate of return on capital cannot vary by even as little as a tenth of a percent: any attempt to alter the net return (for example, by changing tax policy) will trig- ger an infinitely powerful reaction in one sense or another (saving or dissav- ing) in order to force the net return back to its unique equilibrium. Such a prediction is scarcely realistic: history shows that the elasticity of saving is positive but not infinite, especially when the rate of return varies within mod- erate and reasonable limits.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-50" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Another difficulty with this theoretical model (in its strictest interpreta- tion) is that it implies that the rate of return on capital, r, must, in order to maintain the economy in equilibrium, rise very rapidly with the growth rate g, so that the gap between r and g should be greater in a rapidly growing economy than in one that is not growing at all. Once again, this prediction is not very realistic, nor is it compatible with historical experience (the return on capital may rise in a rapidly growing economy but probably not enough to increase the gap r − g significantly, to judge by observed historical experience), and it, too, is a consequence of the infinite horizon hypothesis. Note, how- ever, that the intuition here is again partially valid and in any case interesting from a strictly logical point of view. In the standard economic model, based on the existence of a “perfect” market for capital (in which each owner of capital receives a return equal to the highest marginal productivity available in the economy, and everyone can borrow as much as he or she wants at that rate), the reason why the return on capital, r, is systematically and necessarily higher than the growth rate, g, is the following. If r were less than g, economic agents, realizing that their future income (and that of their descendants) will rise faster than the rate at which they can borrow, will feel infinitely wealthy and will therefore wish to borrow without limit in order to consume immedi- ately (until r rises above g). In this extreme form, the mechanism is not en- tirely plausible, but it shows that r &gt; g is true in the most standard of economic models and is even more likely to be true as capital markets become more efficient.</p>

    <p>To recap: savings behavior and attitudes toward the future cannot be en- capsulated in a single parameter. These choices need to be analyzed in more complex models, involving not only time preference but also precautionary savings, life-cycle effects, the importance attached to wealth in itself, and many other factors. These choices depend on the social and institutional envi- ronment (such as the existence of a public pension system), family strategies and pressures, and limitations that social groups impose on themselves (for example, in some aristocratic societies, heirs are not free to sell family prop- erty), in addition to individual psychological and cultural factors.</p>

    <p>To my way of thinking, the inequality r &gt; g should be analyzed as a his- torical reality dependent on a variety of mechanisms and not as an absolute logical necessity. It is the result of a confluence of forces, each largely indepen- dent of the others. For one thing, the rate of growth, g, tends to be structur- ally low (generally not much more than 1 percent a year once the demographic transition is complete and the country reaches the world technological fron- tier, where the pace of innovation is fairly slow). For another, the rate of re- turn on capital, r, depends on many technological, psychological, social, and cultural factors, which together seem to result in a return of roughly 4–5 percent (in any event distinctly greater than 1 percent).</p>

    <h3>Is There an Equilibrium Distribution?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Let me now turn to the consequences of r &gt; g for the dynamics of the wealth distribution. The fact that the return on capital is distinctly and persistently greater than the growth rate is a powerful force for a more unequal distribu- tion of wealth. For example, if g = 1 percent and r = 5 percent, wealthy individ- uals have to reinvest only one-fifth of their annual capital income to ensure that their capital will grow faster than average income. Under these conditions, the only forces that can avoid an indefinite inegalitarian spiral and stabilize inequality of wealth at a finite level are the following. First, if the fortunes of wealthy individuals grow more rapidly than average income, the capital/ income ratio will rise indefinitely, which in the long run should lead to a de- crease in the rate of return on capital. Nevertheless, this mechanism can take decades to operate, especially in an open economy in which wealthy individu- als can accumulate foreign assets, as was the case in Britain and France in the nineteenth century and up to the eve of World War I. In principle, this pro- cess always comes to an end (when those who own foreign assets take posses- sion of the entire planet), but this can obviously take time. This process was largely responsible for the vertiginous increase in the top centile’s share of wealth in Britain and France during the Belle Époque.
Furthermore, in regard to the trajectories of individual fortunes, this di- vergent process can be countered by shocks of various kinds, whether demo- graphic (such as the absence of an heir or the presence of too many heirs, leading to dispersal of the family capital, or early death, or prolonged life) or economic (such as a bad investment or a peasant uprising or a financial crisis or a mediocre season, etc.). Shocks of this sort always affect family fortunes, so that changes in the wealth distribution occur even in the most static societ- ies. Note, moreover, the importance of demographic choices (the fewer chil- dren the rich choose to have, the more concentrated wealth becomes) and inheritance laws.</p>

    <p>Many traditional aristocratic societies were based on the principle of pri- mogeniture: the eldest son inherited all (or at any rate a disproportionately large share) of the family property so as to avoid fragmentation and to pre- serve or increase the family’s wealth. The eldest son’s privilege concerned the family’s primary estate in particular and often placed heavy constraints on the property: the heir was not allowed to diminish its value and was obliged to live on the income from the capital, which was then conveyed in turn to the next heir in the line of succession, usually the eldest grandson. In British law this was the system of “entails” (the equivalent in French law being the system of substitution héréditaire under the Ancien Régime). It was the reason for the misfortune of Elinor and Marianne in Sense and Sensibility: the Nor- land estate passed directly to their father and half-brother, John Dashwood, who decided, after considering the matter with his wife, Fanny, to leave them nothing. The fate of the two sisters is a direct consequence of this sinister con- versation. In Persuasion, Sir Walter’s estate goes directly to his nephew, by- passing his three daughters. Jane Austen, herself disfavored by inheritance and left a spinster along with her sister, knew what she was talking about.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The inheritance law that derived from the French Revolution and the Civil Code that followed rested on two main pillars: the abolition of substitu- tions héréditaires and primogeniture and the adoption of the principle of equal division of property among brothers and sisters (equipartition). This principle has been applied strictly and consistently since 1804: in France, the quotité disponible (that is, the share of the estate that parents are free to dis- pose of as they wish) is only a quarter of total wealth for parents with three or more children,20 and exemption is granted only in extreme circumstances (for example, if the children murder their stepmother). It is important to under- stand that the new law was based not only on a principle of equality (younger children were valued as much as the eldest and protected from the whims of the parents) but also on a principle of liberty and economic efficiency. In par- ticular, the abolition of entails, which Adam Smith disliked and Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu abhorred, rested on a simple idea: this abolition allowed the free circulation of goods and the possibility of reallocating prop- erty to the best possible use in the judgment of the living generation, despite what dead ancestors may have thought. </p>

    <p>Interestingly, after considerable de- bate, Americans came to the same conclusion in the years after the Revolu- tion: entails were forbidden, even in the South. As Thomas Jefferson famously put it, “the Earth belongs to the living.” And equipartition of estates among siblings became the legal default, that is, the rule that applied in the absence of an explicit will (although the freedom to make one’s will as one pleases still prevails in both the United States and Britain, in practice most estates are equally divided among siblings). This was an important difference between France and the United States on the one hand, where the law of equipartition applied from the nineteenth century on, and Britain on the other, where primo- geniture remained the default in 1925 for a portion of the parental property, namely, landed and agricultural capital.21 In Germany, it was not until the Wei- mar Republic that the German equivalent of entails was abolished in 1919.</p>

    <p>During the French Revolution, this egalitarian, antiauthoritarian, liberal legislation (which challenged parental authority while affirming that of the new family head, in some case to the detriment of his spouse) was greeted with considerable optimism, at least by men—despite being quite radical for the time.23 Proponents of this revolutionary legislation were convinced that they had found the key to future equality. Since, moreover, the Civil Code granted everyone equal rights with respect to the market and property, and guilds had been abolished, the ultimate outcome seemed clear: such a system would inevitably eliminate the inequalities of the past. The marquis de Con- dorcet gave forceful expression to this optimistic view in his Esquisse d’un tableau historique des progrès de l’esprit humain (1794): “It is easy to prove that fortunes tend naturally toward equality, and that excessive differences of wealth either cannot exist or must promptly cease, if the civil laws do not es- tablish artificial ways of perpetuating and amassing such fortunes, and if freedom of commerce and industry eliminate the advantage that any prohibi- tive law or fiscal privilege gives to acquired wealth.”</p>

    <h3>The Civil Code and the Illusion of the French Revolution</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>How, then, are we to explain the fact that the concentration of wealth in- creased steadily in France throughout the nineteenth century and ultimately peaked in the Belle Époque at a level even more extreme than when the Civil Code was introduced and scarcely less than in monarchical and aristocratic Britain? Clearly, equality of rights and opportunities is not enough to ensure an egalitarian distribution of wealth.</p>

<p>Indeed, once the rate of return on capital significantly and durably ex- ceeds the growth rate, the dynamics of the accumulation and transmission of wealth automatically lead to a very highly concentrated distribution, and egali- tarian sharing among siblings does not make much of a difference. As I men- tioned a moment ago, there are always economic and demographic shocks that affect the trajectories of individual family fortunes. With the aid of a fairly simple mathematical model, one can show that for a given structure of shocks of this kind, the distribution of wealth tends toward a long-run equi- librium and that the equilibrium level of inequality is an increasing function of the gap r − g between the rate of return on capital and the growth rate. In- tuitively, the difference r − g measures the rate at which capital income diverges from average income if none of it is consumed and everything is reinvested in the capital stock. The greater the difference r − g, the more powerful the di- vergent force. If the demographic and economic shocks take a multiplicative form (i.e., the greater the initial capital, the greater the effect of a good or bad investment), the long-run equilibrium distribution is a Pareto distribution (a mathematical form based on a power law, which corresponds fairly well to distributions observed in practice). One can also show fairly easily that the coefficient of the Pareto distribution (which measures the degree of inequal- ity) is a steeply increasing function of the difference r − g.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Concretely, what this means is that if the gap between the return on capi- tal and the growth rate is as high as that observed in France in the nineteenth century, when the average rate of return was 5 percent a year and growth was roughly 1 percent, the model predicts that the cumulative dynamics of wealth accumulation will automatically give rise to an extremely high concentration of wealth, with typically around 90 percent of capital owned by the top decile and more than 50 percent by the top centile.</p>

    <p>In other words, the fundamental inequality r &gt; g can explain the very high level of capital inequality observed in the nineteenth century, and thus in a sense the failure of the French Revolution. Although the revolutionary assem- blies established a universal tax (and in so doing provided us with a peerless instrument for measuring the distribution of wealth), the tax rate was so low (barely 1–2 percent on directly transmitted estates, no matter how large, throughout the nineteenth century) that it had no measurable impact on the difference between the rate of return on capital and the growth rate. Under these conditions, it is no surprise that inequality of wealth was as great in nineteenth-century France and even during the republican Belle Époque as in monarchical Britain. The formal nature of the regime was of little moment compared with the inequality r &gt; g.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-61" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Equipartition of estates between siblings did have some effect, but less than the gap r − g. Concretely, primogeniture (or, more precisely, primogeniture on agricultural land, which accounted for a decreasing share of British national capital over the course of the nineteenth century), magnified the effects of demographic and economic shocks (creating additional inequality depending on one’s rank in the sibling order) and thus increased the Pareto coefficient and gave rise to a more concentrated distribution of wealth. This may help to explain why the top decile’s share of total wealth was greater in Britain than in France in 1900–1910 (slightly more than 90 percent, compared with slightly less in France), and especially why the top centile’s share was significantly greater on the British side of the Channel (70 percent v. 60 percent), since this appears to have been based on the preservation of a small number of very large landed estates. But this effect was partly compensated by France’s low demo- graphic growth rate (cumulative inequality of wealth is structurally greater when the population is stagnant, again because of the difference between r and g), and in the end it had only a moderate effect on the overall distribution, which was fairly close in the two countries.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In Paris, where the Napoleonic Civil Code came into effect in 1804 and where inequality cannot be laid at the door of British aristocrats and the queen of England, the top centile owned more than 70 percent of total wealth in 1913, even more than in Britain. The reality was so striking that it even found expression in an animated cartoon, The Aristocats, set in Paris in 1910. The size of the old lady’s fortune is not mentioned, but to judge by the splen- dor of her residence and by the zeal of her butler Edgar to get rid of Duchesse and her three kittens, it must have been considerable.
In terms of the r &gt; g logic, the fact that the growth rate increased from barely 0.2 percent prior to 1800 to 0.5 percent in the eighteenth century and then to 1 percent in the nineteenth century does not seem to have made much of a difference: it was still small compared to a return on capital of around 5 percent, especially since the Industrial Revolution appears to have slightly increased that return.28 According to the theoretical model, if the return on capital is around 5 percent a year, the equilibrium concentration of capital will not decrease significantly unless the growth rate exceeds 1.5–2 percent or taxes on capital reduce the net return to below 3–3.5 percent, or both.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Note, finally, that if the difference r − g surpasses a certain threshold, there is no equilibrium distribution: inequality of wealth will increase without limit, and the gap between the peak of the distribution and the average will grow indefinitely. The exact level of this threshold of course depends on savings be- havior: divergence is more likely to occur if the very wealthy have nothing to spend their money on and no choice but to save and add to their capital stock. The Aristocats calls attention to the problem: Adélaïde de Bonnefamille obvi- ously enjoys a handsome income, which she lavishes on piano lessons and painting classes for Duchesse, Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz, who are some- what bored by it all.29 This kind of behavior explains quite well the rising con- centration of wealth in France, and particularly in Paris, in the Belle Époque: the largest fortunes increasingly belonged to the elderly, who saved a large frac- tion of their capital income, so that their capital grew significantly faster than the economy. As noted, such an inegalitarian spiral cannot continue indefi- nitely: ultimately, there will be no place to invest the savings, and the global return on capital will fall, until an equilibrium distribution emerges. But that can take a very long time, and since the top centile’s share of Parisian wealth in 1913 already exceeded 70 percent, it is legitimate to ask how high the equilib- rium level would have been had the shocks due to World War I not occurred.</p>

    <h3>Pareto and the Illusion of Stable Inequality</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>It is worth pausing a moment to discuss some methodological and historical issues concerning the statistical measurement of inequality. In Chapter 7, I discussed the Italian statistician Corrado Gini and his famous coefficient. Although the Gini coefficient was intended to sum up inequality in a single number, it actually gives a simplistic, overly optimistic, and difficult-to- interpret picture of what is really going on. A more interesting case is that of Gini’s compatriot Vilfredo Pareto, whose major works, including a discussion of the famous “Pareto law,” were published between 1890 and 1910. In the in- terwar years, the Italian Fascists adopted Pareto as one of their own and pro- moted his theory of elites. Although they were no doubt seeking to capitalize on his prestige, it is nevertheless true that Pareto, shortly before his death in 1923, hailed Mussolini’s accession to power. Of course the Fascists would naturally have been attracted to Pareto’s theory of stable inequality and the pointlessness of trying to change it.
What is more striking when one reads Pareto’s work with the benefit of hindsight is that he clearly had no evidence to support his theory of stability. Pareto was writing in 1900 or thereabouts. He used available tax tables from 1880–1890, based on data from Prussia and Saxony as well as several Swiss and Italian cities. The information was scanty and covered a decade at most. What is more, it showed a slight trend toward higher inequality, which Pareto inten- tionally sought to hide.30 In any case, it is clear that such data provide no basis whatsoever for any conclusion about the long-term behavior of inequality around the world.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-65" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Pareto’s judgment was clearly influenced by his political prejudices: he was above all wary of socialists and what he took to be their redistributive illusions. In this respect he was hardly different from any number of contemporary col- leagues, such as the French economist Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu, whom he admired. Pareto’s case is interesting because it illustrates the powerful illusion of eter- nal stability, to which the uncritical use of mathematics in the social sciences sometimes leads. Seeking to find out how rapidly the number of taxpayers de- creases as one climbs higher in the income hierarchy, Pareto discovered that the rate of decrease could be approximated by a mathematical law that subsequently became known as “Pareto’s law” or, alternatively, as an instance of a general class of functions known as “power laws.”31 Indeed, this family of functions is still used today to study distributions of wealth and income. Note, however, that the power law applies only to the upper tail of these distributions and that the rela- tion is only approximate and locally valid. It can nevertheless be used to model processes due to multiplicative shocks, like those described earlier.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-66" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Note, moreover, that we are speaking not of a single function or curve but of a family of functions: everything depends on the coefficients and parame- ters that define each individual curve. The data collected in the WTID as well as the data on wealth presented here show that these Pareto coefficients have varied enormously over time. When we say that a distribution of wealth is a Pareto distribution, we have not really said anything at all. It may be a distribution in which the upper decile receives only slightly more than 20 percent of total income (as in Scandinavia in 1970–1980) or one in which the upper decile receives 50 percent (as in the United States in 2000–2010) or one in which the upper decile owns more than 90 percent of total wealth (as in France and Britain in 1900–1910). In each case we are dealing with a Pareto distribution, but the coefficients are quite different. The corresponding social, economic, and political realities are clearly poles apart.32</p>

    <p>Even today, some people imagine, as Pareto did, that the distribution of wealth is rock stable, as if it were somehow a law of nature. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. When we study inequality in historical per- spective, the important thing to explain is not the stability of the distribution but the significant changes that occur from time to time. In the case of the wealth distribution, I have identified a way to explain the very large historical variations that occur (whether described in terms of Pareto coefficients or as shares of the top decile and centile) in terms of the difference r − g between the rate of return on capital and the growth rate of the economy.</p>

    <h3>Why Inequality of Wealth Has Not Returned to the Levels of the Past</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>I come now to the essential question: Why has the inequality of wealth not returned to the level achieved in the Belle Époque, and can we be sure that this situation is permanent and irreversible?</p>

<p>Let me state at the outset that I have no definitive and totally satisfactory answer to this question. Several factors have played important roles in the past and will continue to do so in the future, and it is quite simply impossible to achieve mathematical certainty on this point.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The very substantial reduction in inequality of wealth following the shocks of 1914–1945 is the easiest part to explain. Capital suffered a series of extremely violent shocks as a result of the wars and the policies to which they gave rise, and the capital/income ratio therefore collapsed. One might of course think that the reduction of wealth would have affected all fortunes proportionately, regardless of their rank in the hierarchy, leaving the distri- bution of wealth unchanged. But to believe this one would have to forget the fact that wealth has different origins and fulfills different functions. At the very top of the hierarchy, most wealth was accumulated long ago, and it takes much longer to reconstitute such a large fortune than to accumulate a mod- est one.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-70" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Furthermore, the largest fortunes serve to finance a certain lifestyle. The detailed probate records collected from the archives show unambiguously that many rentiers in the interwar years did not reduce expenses sufficiently rapidly to compensate for the shocks to their fortunes and income during the war and in the decade that followed, so that they eventually had to eat into their capital to finance current expenditures. Hence they bequeathed to the next generation fortunes significantly smaller than those they had inherited, and the previous social equilibrium could no longer be sustained. The Pari- sian data are particularly eloquent on this point. For example, the wealthiest 1 percent of Parisians in the Belle Époque had capital income roughly 80–100 times as great as the average wage of that time, which enabled them to live very well and still reinvest a small portion of their income and thus increase their inherited wealth.33 From 1872 to 1912, the system appears to have been perfectly balanced: the wealthiest individuals passed on to the next generation enough to finance a lifestyle requiring 80–100 times the average wage or even a bit more, so that wealth became even more concentrated. This equilibrium clearly broke down in the interwar years: the wealthiest 1 percent of Parisians continued to live more or less as they had always done but left the next genera- tion just enough to yield capital income of 30–40 times the average wage; by the late 1930s, this had fallen to just 20 times the average wage. For the rent- iers, this was the beginning of the end. This was probably the most important reason for the deconcentration of wealth that we see in all European coun- tries (and to a less extent in the United States) in the wake of the shocks of 1914–1945.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-71" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In addition, the composition of the largest fortunes left them (on average) more exposed to losses due to the two world wars. In particular, the probate records show that foreign assets made up as a much as a quarter of the largest fortunes on the eve of World War I, nearly half of which consisted of the sovereign debt of foreign governments (especially Russia, which was on the verge of default). Unfortunately, we do not have comparable data for Britain, but there is no doubt that foreign assets played at least as important a role in the largest British fortunes. In both France and Britain, foreign assets virtu- ally disappeared after the two world wars.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-72" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>The importance of this factor should not be overstated, however, since the wealthiest individuals were often in a good position to reallocate their portfo- lios at the most profitable moment. It is also striking to discover that many individuals, and not just the wealthiest, owned significant amounts of foreign assets on the eve of World War I. When we examine the structure of Parisian portfolios in the late nineteenth century and Belle Époque, we find that they were highly diversified and quite “modern” in their composition. On the eve of the war, about a third of assets were in real estate (of which approximately two-thirds was in Paris and one-third in the provinces, including a small amount of agricultural land), while financial assets made up almost two- thirds. The latter consisted of both French and foreign stocks and (public as well as private) bonds, fairly well balanced at all levels of wealth (see Table 10.1).34 The society of rentiers that flourished in the Belle Époque was not a society of the past based on static landed capital: it embodied a modern atti- tude toward wealth and investment. But the cumulative inegalitarian logic of r &gt; g made it prodigiously and persistently inegalitarian. In such a society, there is not much chance that freer, more competitive markets or more secure prop- erty rights can reduce inequality, since markets were already highly competi- tive and property rights firmly secured. In fact, the only thing that undermined this equilibrium was the series of shocks to capital and its income that began with World War I.</p>

    <p>Finally, the period 1914–1945 ended in a number of European countries, and especially in France, with a redistribution of wealth that affected the largest fortunes disproportionately, especially those consisting largely of stock in large industrial firms. Recall, in particular, the nationalization of certain companies as a sanction after Liberation (the Renault automobile company is the emblematic example), as well as the national solidarity tax, which was also imposed in 1945. This progressive tax was a one-time levy on both capital and acquisitions made during the Occupation, but the rates were extremely high and imposed an additional burden on the individuals affected.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In the end, then, it is hardly surprising that the concentration of wealth de- creased sharply everywhere between 1910 and 1950. In other words, the de- scending portion of Figures 10.1–5 is not the most difficult part to explain. The more surprising part at first glance, and in a way the more interesting part, is that the concentration of wealth never recovered from the shocks I have been discussing.
To be sure, it is important to recognize that capital accumulation is a long- term process extending over several generations. The concentration of wealth in Europe during the Belle Époque was the result of a cumulative process over many decades or even centuries. It was not until 2000–2010 that total private wealth (in both real estate and financial assets), expressed in years of national income, regained roughly the level it had attained on the eve of World War I. This restoration of the capital/income ratio in the rich countries is in all prob- ability a process that is still ongoing.</p>

    <p>It is not very realistic to think that the violent shocks of 1914–1945 could have been erased in ten or twenty years, thereby restoring by 1950–1960 a con- centration of wealth equal to that seen in 1900–1910. Note, too, that inequal- ity of wealth began to rise again in 1970–1980. It is therefore possible that a catch-up process is still under way today, a process even slower than the re- vival of the capital/income ratio, and that the concentration of wealth will soon return to past heights.</p>

    <p>In other words, the reason why wealth today is not as unequally distributed as in the past is simply that not enough time has passed since 1945. This is no doubt part of the explanation, but by itself it is not enough. When we look at the top decile’s share of wealth and even more at the top centile’s (which was 60–70 percent across Europe in 1910 and only 20–30 percent in 2010), it seems clear that the shocks of 1914–1945 caused a structural change that is preventing wealth from becoming quite as concentrated as it was previously. The point is not simply quantitative—far from it. In the next chapter, we will see that when we look again at the question raised by Vautrin’s lecture on the different stan- dards of living that can be attained by inheritance and labor, the difference between a 60–70 percent share for the top centile and a 20–30 percent share is relatively simple. In the first case, the top centile of the income hierarchy is very clearly dominated by top capital incomes: this is the society of rentiers familiar to nineteenth-century novelists. In the second case, top earned incomes (for a given distribution) roughly balance top capital incomes (we are now in a soci- ety of managers, or at any rate a more balanced society). Similarly, the emer- gence of a “patrimonial middle class” owning between a quarter and a third of national wealth rather than a tenth or a twentieth (scarcely more than the poorest half of society) represents a major social transformation.</p>

    <p>What structural changes occurred between 1914 and 1945, and more gen- erally during the twentieth century, that are preventing the concentration of wealth from regaining its previous heights, even though private wealth overall is prospering almost as handsomely today as in the past? The most natural and important explanation is that governments in the twentieth century began taxing capital and its income at significant rates. It is important to notice that the very high concentration of wealth observed in 1900–1910 was the result of a long period without a major war or catastrophe (at least when compared to the extreme violence of twentieth-century conflicts) as well as without, or al- most without, taxes. Until World War I there was no tax on capital income or corporate profits. In the rare cases in which such taxes did exist, they were assessed at very low rates. Hence conditions were ideal for the accumulation and transmission of considerable fortunes and for living on the income of those fortunes. In the twentieth century, taxes of various kinds were imposed on dividends, interest, profits, and rents, and this changed things radically.</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To simplify matters: assume initially that capital income was taxed at an average rate close to 0 percent (and in any case less than 5 percent) before 1900–1910 and at about 30 percent in the rich countries in 1950–1980 (and to some extent until 2000–2010, although the recent trend has been clearly down- ward as governments engage in fiscal competition spearheaded by smaller countries). An average tax rate of 30 percent reduces a pretax return of 5 per- cent to a net return of 3.5 percent after taxes. This in itself is enough to have significant long-term effects, given the multiplicative and cumulative logic of capital accumulation and concentration. Using the theoretical models de- scribed above, one can show that an effective tax rate of 30 percent, if applied to all forms of capital, can by itself account for a very significant deconcentra- tion of wealth (roughly equal to the decrease in the top centile’s share that we see in the historical data).</p>

  <article data-timings="">
    <p>In this context, it is important to note that the effect of the tax on capital income is not to reduce the total accumulation of wealth but to modify the structural transformations. It is worth reiterating that the concentration of wealth today, though markedly lower than in 1900–1910, remains extremely high. It does not require a perfect, ideal tax system to achieve such a result or to explain a transformation whose magnitude should not be exaggerated.</p>

    <h3>The Twenty-First Century: Even More Inegalitarian Than the Nineteenth?</h3>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Given the many mechanisms in play and the multiple uncertainties involved in tax simulations, it would nevertheless be going too far to conclude that no other factors played a significant role. My analysis thus far has shown that two factors probably did play an important part, independent of changes in the tax system, and will continue to do so in the future. The first is the probable slight decrease in capital’s share of income and in the rate of return on capital over the long run, and the second is that the rate of growth, despite a likely slowing in the twenty-first century, will be greater than the extremely low rate observed throughout most of human history up to the eighteenth century. (Here I am speaking of the purely economic component of growth, that is, growth of productivity, which reflects the growth of knowledge and techno- logical innovation.) Concretely, as Figure 10.11 shows, it is likely that the difference r &gt; g will be smaller in the future than it was before the eighteenth century, both because the return on capital will be lower (4–4.5 percent, say, rather than 4.5–5 percent) and growth will be higher (1–1.5 percent rather than 0.1–0.2 percent), even if competition between states leads to the elimi- nation of all taxes on capital. If theoretical simulations are to be believed, the concentration of wealth, even if taxes on capital are abolished, would not necessarily return to the extreme level of 1900–1910.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-81" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>There are no grounds for rejoicing, however, in part because inequality of wealth would still increase substantially (halving the middle-class share of national wealth, for example, which voters might well find unacceptable) and in part because there is considerable uncertainty in the simulations, and other forces exist that may well push in the opposite direction, that is, toward an even greater concentration of capital than in 1900–1910. In particular, demo- graphic growth may be negative (which could drive growth rates, especially in the wealthy countries, below those observed in the nineteenth century, and this would in turn give unprecedented importance to inherited wealth). In addition, capital markets may become more and more sophisticated and more and more “perfect” in the sense used by economists (meaning that the return on capital will become increasingly disconnected from the individual charac- teristics of the owner and therefore cut against meritocratic values, reinforc- ing the logic of r &gt; g). As I will show later, in addition, financial globalization seems to be increasing the correlation between the return on capital and the initial size of the investment portfolio, creating an inequality of returns that acts as an additional—and quite worrisome—force for divergence in the global wealth distribution.</p>

<slide class="" id="slide-82" style="background:;">
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>To sum up: the fact that wealth is noticeably less concentrated in Europe today than it was in the Belle Époque is largely a consequence of accidental events (the shocks of 1914–1945) and specific institutions such as taxation of capital and its income. If those institutions were ultimately destroyed, there would be a high risk of seeing inequalities of wealth close to those observed in the past or, under certain conditions, even higher. Nothing is certain: ine- quality can move in either direction. Hence I must now look more closely at the dynamics of inheritance and then at the global dynamics of wealth. One conclusion is already quite clear, however: it is an illusion to think that some- thing about the nature of modern growth or the laws of the market economy ensures that inequality of wealth will decrease and harmonious stability will be achieved.</p>
