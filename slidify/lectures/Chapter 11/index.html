<li>This set of slides surveys selected topics from <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>, a book written by economist Thomas Piketty, published in English in 2014 to great acclaim.</li>
<li>All source files for this course are available for download by anyone without restrictions at <a href="https://github.com/ptoche/piketty">https://github.com/ptoche/piketty</a></li>
<li>The full course is expected to be completed by April 2015.</li>
<li>Chapter 10 reviewed the historical evolution of wealth inequality and the factors behind the historic compression of inequality.</li>
<li>Chapter 11 analyzes the relative roles of inheritance and saving in capital formation in the long term.</li>
