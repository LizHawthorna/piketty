### The Public Debt

- Governments finance their expenditures with taxes or debt. 
- Some countries get stuck in perpetual debt crises. 
- In the 19th century, UK public debt exceeded 2 years of national income! 
- Today, the average public debt in rich countries is about 1 year of national income (90% of GDP), the highest levels in peace time. In emerging countries, it is around 30% of GDP.
- Thus, the governments of the rich countries are poor. Europe has the highest level of private wealth in the world, and the highest public debt.

### Reducing Public Debt

- To reduce public debt, governments could:
  - `1`. cut public spending;
  - `2`. raise tax revenue;
  - `3`. let inflation reduce the real value of debt.
- In the past, inflation has often been used. Figures 3.3 shows that in just 5 years, between 1945 and 1950, public debt in the UK fell from 200% of GDP to 30%. But today, Europe has chosen austerity.
- Piketty argues that a tax on net private wealth would be just and efficient.

### Reducing Public Debt

- In most European countries, national wealth is close to 6 years of national income, most of it private wealth. The value of public assets is approximately equal to public debt &mdash; net public wealth is about zero.
- In theory, if the public buildings, schools, universities, hospitals, police stations, motorways, bridges, and other infrastructure of Europe were sold at market prices, public debt could be eliminated.
- Private wealth (net of debt) can be divided into two roughly equal halves: real estate and financial assets. 
- Europe's average net asset position with the rest of the world is about zero: firms and public debt are 'owned' by European households &mdash; what the rest of the world owns of Europe is offset by what Europeans own of the rest of the world.
